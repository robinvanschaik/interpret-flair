security warning over fbi virus the us federal bureau of investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via e-mails that purport to be from the fbi. the e-mails show that they have come from an fbi.gov address and tell recipients that they have accessed illegal websites. the messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the fbi s internet fraud complaint center. an attachment in the e-mail contains the virus the fbi said. the message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use. but rather than being a questionnaire the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient s computer according to the agency. it is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know. recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the fbi does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner the fbi said in a statement. the bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. the agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts used to communicate with the public because of a security breach. a spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated.

labour targets hardcore truants a fresh crackdown on persistent truants in england has been launched by education secretary ruth kelly. serial truants make up one in 13 pupils. previous initiatives brought 40 000 pupils back to school since 1997 according to official statistics. parenting contracts penalty notices and fast track prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. it is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. tories say labour s previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence where parents are permitted to take children out of school. such absences are often due to family holidays. however serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing £885m. those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. in one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child s attendance improved. the tough stance paid off with just 24 issued while attendance improved in 776 cases. truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government s behaviour improvement programme. this is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since september. the new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on monday. police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. held twice each year in addition to routine local patrols previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31 000 pupils dodging school. in almost 14 000 of those cases the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. a department for education and skills source said: every day in school counts. it is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation s truancy.

federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic. top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. but ljubicic who beat tim henman in the last eight dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool though turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. the match was a re-run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam where federer triumphed but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets. i really wanted to get off to a good start this time and i did and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm federer said. that took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back and that was a good effort on his side. ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. i didn t start badly but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger if you relax for a second it just goes very quick he said. after those first three games it was no match at all. i don t know it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court. but despite his defeat the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. i had a chance in the third and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match. it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top-class players.

jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland s justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them where it hurts most by banning them from matches. cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. she praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. however the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. the sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue. they plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs church leaders senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. speaking on bbc radio scotland s sunday live programme ms jamieson described friday s meeting as very productive and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. ms jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a trigger for tensions and violence. clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem. ms jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. she said: we can t get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence. that is the kind of thing we want to stop and that s the kind of thing supporters groups are very clear they don t want to be part of either and they will work with us to try and deal with that. ms jamieson praised the police for their action and said: the police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them. we have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches to be able to stop them attending the games. that s the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games she said. praising celtic and rangers for their efforts she said: i don t think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs. both rangers and celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce for example an educational pack for young people.

top of the pops leaves bbc one the bbc s flagship pop music programme top of the pops is to move from bbc one on fridays to sundays on bbc two. the new programme will combine with archive show totp2 mixing new music with footage of classic bands. the corporation said the new show aims to appeal to a diverse audience of music lovers . the move is the biggest shake-up in the history of the show which was first broadcast in 1964 and has always been on bbc one. top of the pops was relaunched in a blaze of publicity in december last year in an attempt to reverse a long-term decline in audience figures. the all new top of the pops was fronted by newcomer tim kash and was put together by producer andi peters who was brought back to the bbc from channel 4 to revitalise the series. about three million people a week were watching the show on fridays - less than half the total it was attracting in the mid-1990s - as the programme went up against popular itv soap coronation street. but despite the relaunch audience figures failed to rise and still remain around the three million mark. tim kash has since been replaced as host by fearne cotton. the new show will launch in spring next year in an extended format. bbc two controller roly keating: it s an exciting new era for top of the pops. we want to make it bigger and better so that it becomes the ultimate pop music show for music lovers of every generation. mr keating described bbc two as the natural home of top of the pops. he added: the addition of top of the pops will also extend bbc two s offering to younger audiences. a bbc spokeswoman said andi peters would continue as executive producer on the show. she said that issues over the exact format of the programme and a time slot were still to be decided. the programme will have a close relationship with the bbc radio 1 chart show which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on sundays. hopefully the audience for top of the pops will find it on bbc two. we think that the new slot will create a buzz around the programme as for the first time viewers will discover the news of who is number one as it happens.

us company admits benin bribery a us defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $28.5m after admitting bribery in the west african state of benin. the titan corporation was accused of funnelling more than $2m into the 2001 re-election campaign of president mathieu kerekou. at the time titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in benin. there is no suggestion that mr kerekou was himself aware of any wrongdoing. titan a california-based company pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating us anti-bribery laws. it agreed to pay $13m in criminal penalties as well as $15.5m to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the us financial watchdog the securities and exchange commission (sec). the sec had accused titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in benin claiming ties with president kerekou. some of the money was used to pay for t-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election. shortly after the poll which mr kerekou won benin officials agreed to quadruple titan s management fee. prosecuting attorney carol lam said: all us companies should take note that attempting to bribe foreign officials is criminal conduct and will be appropriately prosecuted. the company says it no longer tolerates such practices. under the us foreign corrupt practices act it is a crime for american firms to bribe foreign officials.

us trade gap hits record in 2004 the gap between us exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004 latest figures show. the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003 s imbalance of $496.5bn. the deficit with china up 30.5% at $162bn was the largest ever recorded with a single country. however on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in december to £56.4bn. the us consumer s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars and even wine and cheese reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush s economic policies. democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. for example they believe china s currency policy - which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given china s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors. meanwhile the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world spurring on more demand for imported goods. some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter. but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets which may in turn harm growth. for all of 2004 us exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. imports were not affected by the dollar s weakness last year. we expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend said economist marie-pierre ripert at ixis.

mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system mps have said. the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. courts should be used as a last resort but where they are their orders should be enforced more rigorously mps said. but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access. currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. an arbitrary template imposed on all families whatever the needs of the child would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position the mps said. they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. this would reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety they said. delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed a new status quo arrangement for the children to become established by default they said. although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present. given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents. committee chairman alan beith said the five-month inquiry had been a complex and emotive one. at the moment far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation he said. this situation has to change. the court system should only be used as a last resort where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with. this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.

peers debate crown succession law peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne. labour peer lord dubs succession to the crown bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. the private member s bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. the fabian society s sundar katwala said the change was long overdue and that he expected a warm response . the political reform group s general secretary told bbc radio 4 s today programme there were some very out-dated features at the heart of britain s constitution. in 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures. we hope they are warm towards it and don t say this is the wrong time. he pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill. mr katwala added: this is long overdue. parliament will have to do it eventually the government and i hope all of the political parties might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos. but he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election. he said he hoped the bill would be a gentle nudge to the government and suggested it would demand a response . the bill which is in the lords for its second reading has been adopted by former chief whip ann taylor in the commons. the rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the act of settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for parliament to determine the title to the throne.

parents face video game lessons ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry. the issue was discussed at a meeting between uk government officials industry representatives and the british board of film classification. it follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. in 2003 britons spent £1 152m on games more than ever before. and this christmas parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles. violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old stefan pakeerah who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother giselle said her son s killer warren leblanc 17 - who was jailed for life in september - had mimicked behaviour in the game. police investigating stefan s murder dismissed its influence and said manhunt was not part of its legal case. the issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on sunday by trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt. this was the focus of the talks between government officials representatives from the games industry and the british board of film classification. adults can make informed choices about what games to play. children can t and they deserve to be protected said culture secretary tessa jowell after the meeting. industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn t play. roger bennett director general of entertainment and leisure software publishers association said: a number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting. they will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding recognition and awareness of the games rating system ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content. among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves. according to industry statistics a majority of players are over 18 with the average age of a gamer being 29. academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as manhunt with violent responses in players. in a report published this week for the video standards council dr guy cumberbatch said: the research evidence on media violence causing harm to viewers is wildly exaggerated and does not stand up to scrutiny. dr cumberbatch head of the social policy think tank the communications research group reviewed the studies on the issue. he concluded that there was an absence of convincing research that media violence caused harm.

dollar hits new low versus euro the us dollar has continued its record-breaking slide and has tumbled to a new low against the euro. investors are betting that the european central bank (ecb) will not do anything to weaken the euro while the us is thought to favour a declining dollar. the us is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit and analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a depreciation of the dollar. they have predicted that the dollar is likely to fall even further. the us currency was trading at $1.364 per euro at 1800 gmt on monday. this compares with $1.354 to the euro in late trading in new york on friday which was then a record low. the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about $1.20 against the euro. it has lost 7% this year while against the japanese yen it is down 3.2%. traders said that thin trading levels had amplified monday s move. it s not going to take much to push [the dollar] one way or the other said grant wilson of mellon bank. liquidity - a measure of the number of parties willing to trade in the market - was about half that of a normal working day traders said.

industrial revival hope for japan japanese industry is growing faster than expected boosting hopes that the country s retreat back into recession is over. industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in january from a month earlier. at the same time retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. the news sent tokyo shares to an eight-month high as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from april 2004 on. the nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11 740.60 points with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. weaker exports normally the engine for japan s economy in the face of weak domestic demand had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking gdp. only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. the output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials. overall i see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession said bank of japan chief toshihiko fukui despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying. within the overall industrial output figure there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars chemicals and electronic goods. with us growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market with products such as flat-screen tvs in high demand during january.

burglar defence guidelines issued householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting honestly and instinctively new guidelines say. the law also protects those who use something to hand as a weapon. the leaflet published by police and prosecutors aims to combat confusion about current legislation which lets people use reasonable force . the guidance relating to england and wales follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. doing what you honestly and instinctively believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully the guidance said. and the law protects those who use something to hand as a weapon said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service (cps) and association of chief police officers (acpo). as a general rule the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence it said adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of excessive and gratuitous force. the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use grossly disproportionate force. their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens. tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member s bill in parliament. the government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. home secretary charles clarke said: i believe in that old adage an englishman s home is his castle . that s exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that. an informal trawl of cps records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years five of whom were convicted. they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire before beating him up throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire. a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. in one of britain s highest profile cases norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar fred barras in 1999. the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. mr martin was freed from prison in july 2003. the guidance published on tuesday said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were determined they would be dealt with as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible it said.

warnings about junk mail deluge the amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase say experts. anti-spam group spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent. before now many spammers have recruited home pcs to act as anonymous e-mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail. the pcs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program. once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers. spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. in this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate. as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. steve linford director of spamhaus predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net s e-mail sending infrastructure. david stanley uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers. they are adding to their armoury he said. the amount of spam in circulation was still growing said mr stanley but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown. but kevin hogan senior manager at symantec security response said such warnings were premature. if something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago said mr hogan. while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too. mr hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses. for instance said mr hogan filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam.

russian oil merger excludes yukos the merger of russian gas giant gazprom and oil firm rosneft is to go ahead but will not include yugansk which was controversially bought last year. the merger backed by russian authorities will allow foreigners to trade in gazprom shares. gazprom chief alexei miller confirmed rosneft-owned yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off. under the agreement the state will get a controlling share of gazprom in exchange for rosneft. the state wanted to control gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade. speaking on ntv television which is controlled by gazprom mr miller added that yugansk which was swallowed up by rosneft late last year will operate as a separate state-owned oil firm headed by current rosneft chief sergei bogdanchikov. according to reports from russian news agency interfax the deal should go through in the next two to three months. obtaining majority control over gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in gazprom shares mr miller added. by opening up trading in gazprom to foreigners the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders. currently foreigners can only trade in gazprom via a small issue of london-listed proxy shares. this is positive news for the international investment community global asset management investment chief david smith said. the majority of investors are going to be happy he added. however analysts were disappointed that yugansk would not be included in the deal. yugansk is a heavy cashflow generator and would have been a much better asset for gazprom renaissance capital energy analyst adam landes told reuters news agency. but he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in gazprom. ultimately and industrially gazprom needs yugansk he added. analysts said the deal would give gazprom control of 8% of russia s total oil production an improvement on its current 2.5% but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over yugansk. however the merged group will still remain outside russia s top five oil producers - led by lukoil with 11% of the market followed by tnk-bp which is half owned by bp and surgutneftegaz. instead the merged gazprom-rosneft group will rank alongside sibneft with 7% of the market. yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in december following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on yukos. the shell company was then snapped up by rosneft. yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the us courts. the unit was auctioned by russian authorities to help pay off a $27.5bn back-tax bill.

giggs handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his 50th cap in wednesday s friendly against hungary in cardiff. john toshack in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark. with the games he s played for united proportionately it doesn t seem that many for wales toshack said. but he s one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it s appropriate he s captain. giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game but is now targetting playing for wales in the 2008 european championships. the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career. i briefly discussed my international future with sir alex but he urged me to carry on giggs said. he feels like myself that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit so in three or four years time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there. the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because i am fit enough. giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united team-mate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991 an away loss to germany and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. with giggs leading wales out against hungary there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed. however toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as a long-term option. for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain it s his 50th cap and he s known for some time about that toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes and giggs said: it s my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in. it s important to be here all the players feel the same. it s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important. i see myself leading by example it is something i have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons. the way john is looking at things he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament the euro 2006 event. i have told john i will be around for the next european tournament by then i will be 35 so hopefully i will still be okay. a lot can happen but i m hoping to be around. giggs own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two. i have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment said giggs. it is an important period for the club and i am just concentrated on that. i ve heard the suggestions hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what i am looking for to get it sorted out. i m enjoying my football the way united have been playing and my own form you have to enjoy it. we have massive games coming up: manchester city this week then the everton cup tie followed by ac milan in the champions league and my first wales game under john toshack so it s an important time.

when invention turns to innovation it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past. when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people s lives substantially. but says nick donofrio senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm it was not the thing itself that actually improved people s lives. it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access. when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century we have to think more like this but faster mr donofrio told the bbc news website after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture. the invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had. the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did. these are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them. we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology argues mr donofrio industry week s 2003 technology leader of the year. the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life gets better as a result. in the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes. somebody had a new thing that would awe you. you weren t quite sure that it did anything you weren t quite sure if you needed it you weren t quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool. but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face . it will creep in pervasively. nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage. i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure says mr donofrio. pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards. the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there like air. people will not have to do anything to stay connected. people will know their lives are just better says mr donofrio. trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know. natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances. ultimately there will be says mr donofrio no value in being computer illiterate . to some it sounds like a technological world gone mad. to mr donofrio it is a vision innovation that will happen. behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing says mr donofrio. deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing. it has value according to ibm because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates. but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts commands and requirements of a diverse world. as computing and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture walls and clothing physical space becomes a more important consideration. this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience. i am confident that the set [science engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills he says. if i am right about what innovation is you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. women tend to have those traits a lot better than men. eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he says. in the uk a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40% representation on set industry boards. ibm according to mr donofrio has 30%. our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career. the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio. we believe in the whole issue of global diversity he says. our customers are diverse our clients are diverse. they expect us to look like them. as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them.

brazil buy boosts belgium s inbev belgian brewing giant inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of brazil s biggest beer firm ambev last year. inbev which makes stella artois said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; £800m) and said it expected solid growth in 2005. the performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. the firm formerly interbrew became the world s biggest brewer by volume when it bought ambev in august 2004. the acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004 with four months of ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. us beermaker anheuser-busch sells less beer by volume than inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. continuing demand for inbev s products in the south american markets where its brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. it s the brazil business that s doing it said ing analyst gerard rijk of inbev s strong performance. ambev boosted its share of brazil s beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by december 2004 inbev reported. in contrast inbev s european business saw volume sales fall 2.5% although central and eastern european sales rose 12%. overall net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.

net regulation still possible the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said. content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tv-quality video online becomes a norm. at a debate in westminster the net industry considered the options. lord currie chairman of super-regulator ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. at the debate organised by the internet service providers association (ispa) lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation. the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said. adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self-regulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion. some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005 and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net. more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb itv and the bbc. head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. how risque can i be in this new age with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely i can push it to the limit he said. in fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in 2002. this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. huge changes are afoot in 2005 he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net. the bbc s planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said. one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said mr ayers. as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it. mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online . in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content. after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. if content is on-demand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it. there is no watershed on the net said mr burke.

ireland 17-12 south africa ronan o gara scored all ireland s points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over south africa on an emotional day at lansdowne road. o gara s first-half try poached after a quick tap-penalty helped the irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. three further o gara penalties extended ireland s lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. two percy montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but ireland held out to claim a famous victory. ireland began strongly and were never led but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. aware of the threat posed by the south africans ireland pressed hard from the outset and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. early on denis hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but shane horgan s pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee paul honiss. ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. another south african infringement a minute later led to ireland s first points - o gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try. the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when o gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. stung by the score the south africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with geordan murphy s ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for percy montgomery. however the springboks did win a penalty a minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland s lead to 5-3. ireland got out of jail when the south africans had a three-to-one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance. after the sustained springboks pressure the irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with o gara s clever drop-goal to restore his side s lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. sustained irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another o gara penalty. however montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland s lead to five points again. montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent a try. the south africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when schalk burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and o gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty. in the 61st minute hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from girvan dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. however a late tackle on brian o driscoll enabled o gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended ireland s lead to 17-6. however two montgomery penalties had ireland s lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. south africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim a deserved victory. g dempsey; g murphy b o driscoll (capt) s horgan d hickie; r o gara p stringer; r corrigan s byrne j hayes m o kelly p o connell s easterby j o connor a foley. f sheahan m horan d o callaghan e miller g easterby d humphreys k maggs. : p montgomery; b paulse m joubert de wet barry a willemse j van der westhuyzen; f du preez; o du randt j smit (captain) e andrews b botha v matfield s burger aj venter j van niekerk. : h shimange cj van der linde g britz d rossouw m claassens j de villiers g du toit/j fourie. paul honiss (new zealand)	[sport (1.0)]	[sport (0.9998)]
disney backs sony dvd technology a next generation dvd technology backed by sony has received a major boost. film giant disney says it will produce its future dvds using sony s blu-ray disc technology but has not ruled out a rival format developed by toshiba. the two competing dvd formats blu-ray developed by sony and others and toshiba s hd-dvd have been courting top film studios for several months. the next generation of dvds promises very high quality pictures and sound as well as a lot of data. both technologies use a blue laser to write information. it has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s betamax versus vhs war. sony lost out to jvc in that fight. the current battle for hollywood s hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. last month paramount universal and warner brothers said they were opting for the toshiba and nec-backed format hd-dvd high-definition discs. those studios currently produce about 45% of dvd content. sony pictures entertainment and mgm studios have already staked their allegiance with the blu-ray disc association whose members also include technology companies dell samsung and matsushita. twentieth century fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. if fox decided to go with blu-ray too it would mean the format would have a 47% share of dvd content. disney said its films would be available on the blu-ray format when dvd players for the standard went on sale on north america and japan expected in 2006. universal is to start producing films on the hd-dvd format in 2005 and paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. toshiba expects sales of hd-dvds to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn £1.5bn) by 2010.

scots smoking ban details set out smoke-free areas will save lives and improve scotland s health first minister jack mcconnell has insisted. he told the scottish parliament on wednesday that a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. mr mcconnell said the country s health rates were lamentable not least because of smoking. he said fines of up to £2 500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. earlier the scottish executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. in a statement to parliament mr mcconnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force. the health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost he told msps. he said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of europe image becomes a thing of the past . there are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health he declared. health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise drugs abuse excessive drinking and over-eating. they all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in europe and too many smoke. it is clear that scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking. the legislation will be introduced as part of the health service (miscellaneous provisions) bill which will be considered by parliament before christmas. main points of the plan: - a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland - the legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers - licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2 500 - licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence - a system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined - individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1 000. mr mcconnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. he said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in new york and 16% in ireland. mr mcconnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from new york bars and restaurants and in ireland only a one point three per cent volume sales fall where they were declining before the ban. the afternoon announcement following a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning won broad support from opposition parties. the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. she said: the time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. there is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. but we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded. the scottish conservative party leader david mcletchie questioned what would be exempted from the ban. he was keen to know if inmates in scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. mr mcletchie asked: would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister s brave new scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals the scottish green party s health spokeswoman eleanor scott said she was pleased scotland would be following the success stories of new york and ireland . she believed the majority of people in scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.

santy worm makes unwelcome visit thousands of website bulletin boards have been defaced by a virus that used google to spread across the net. the santy worm first appeared on 20 december and within 24 hours had successfully hit more than 40 000 websites. the malicious program exploits a vulnerability in the widely used phpbb software. santy s spread has now been stopped after google began blocking infected sites searching for new victims. the worm replaces chat forums with a webpage announcing that the site had been defaced by the malicious program. soon after being infected sites hit by the worm started randomly searching for other websites running the vulnerable phpbb software. once google started blocking these search queries the rate of infection tailed off sharply. a message sent to finnish security firm f-secure by google s security team said: while a seven hour response for something like this is not outrageous we think we can and should do better. we will be reviewing our procedures to improve our response time in the future to similar problems the google team said. security firms estimate that about 1m websites run their discussion groups and forums with the open source phpbb program. the worst of the attack now seems to be over as a search conducted on the morning of the 22 december produced only 1 440 hits for sites showing the text used in the defacement message. people using the sites hit by santy will not be affected by the worm. santy is not the first malicious program to use google to help it spread. in july a variant of the mydoom virus slowed down searches on google as the program flooded the search site with queries looking for new e-mail addresses to send itself to.

the memory driving brown s mission the memory gordon brown says keeps returning to him - the one that he says is burnt into him - is that of a 12 year-old girl whose parents died of aids and who is hiv positive herself. mr brown seems haunted by her eyes desolate of all hope. and then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism: an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of kenya s largest slum advancing with crowded menace flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of free education - free education for all . mr brown s message generally that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered. but he is such a pivotal figure in british politics it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this. his answer in part is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father s church. ever since he says africa has been important to him. i ve absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt. but he also believes it is time for the world to see a new gordon brown. not the dull reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion - and it just so happens the labour party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators. there s also a sense of liberation. if mr blair won t allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and he d much rather be out examining social problems in the raw. it also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties: scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself. if he can help the world s poor just a little then it shows politics isn t worthless. but is his vision for africa too grand can poverty in the continent really be halved brown replies that no one thought the berlin wall would ever come down either. he s still got to overcome - not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world - but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just won t in the end spend wisely.

us bank boss hails genius smith us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has given a speech at a scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist adam smith. he delivered the 14th adam smith lecture in kirkcaldy fife. the adam smith lecture celebrates the author of 1776 s wealth of nations which became a bible of capitalism. dr greenspan was invited by chancellor gordon brown whose minister father john used to preach at the st bryce kirk church. mr brown introduced dr greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the the world s greatest economist . dr greenspan 79 who has been in the uk to attend the g7 meeting in london said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to smith whose genius he compared to that of mozart. he said the philosopher was a towering contributor to the modern world . kirkcaldy the birthplace in 1723 of adam smith and by extension of modern economics is also of course where your chancellor was reared. i am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor s renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area. he continued: smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics just then emerging worked. in so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living. dr greenspan said smith s revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. the incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the enlightenment - especially with smith toiling in the environs of kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest he said. following his lecture dr greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the queen at balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the royal society of edinburgh. he later opened an exhibition dedicated to smith in the atrium of fife college of further and higher education. joyce johnston principal of the college said: it is very fitting that the world s premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world s first economist. dr greenspan - who became chairman of the federal reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in june 2004 - will step down in january next year. he has served under presidents george w bush bill clinton george bush and ronald reagan. he was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to gerald ford.

saab to build cadillacs in sweden general motors the world s largest car maker has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden. the car unveiled at the geneva motor show is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. it will not be sold in the us said gm europe president carl-peter forster. as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine. gm s announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factory s closure. the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gm s planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations. but the group s new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group s opel workers in ruesselsheim germany. they may now have to face a larger proportion of gm s cuts. neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden since it reflects saab s failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market. for years saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with bmw mercedes and jaguar. the segment s leaders do not agree. gm s plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers. in the us it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe. other luxury car makers most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe. there german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market. bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory which currently produces fewer than 130 000 cars per year. that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. beyond the 12 000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs opels - badged as vauxhalls in the uk - and now cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts. another way to further reduce saab s losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car. doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers. but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news. the current trend towards us production was stupid he said. in a separate announcement gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models. it is to deploy a fleet of 35 000 test cars across 40 countries inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us. gm said it wanted to change customers perceptions about opel and vauxhall cars showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.

tories urge change at the top tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election declaring britain needs a change at the top . the party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and labour. tory co-chairman liam fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising tony blair s record in government. labour s rule has been characterised by lost trust and failure to deliver he told the brighton conference. he also attacked the government s failure to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the shambles of immigration put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools he said. dr fox also underlined tory promises to cut tax by £4bn. bbc political correspondent shaun ley says opinion polls suggest the tories still lag some way behind labour on the issues of health education and the economy. conservative leader michael howard who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.

how to smash a home computer an executive who froze his broken hard disk thinking it would be fixed has topped a list of the weirdest computer mishaps. although computer malfunctions remain the most common cause of file loss data recovery experts say human behaviour still is to blame in many cases. they say that no matter how effective technology is at rescuing files users should take more time to back-up and protect important files. the list of the top 10 global data disasters was compiled by recovery company ontrack. careless - and preventable - mistakes that result in data loss range from reckless file maintenance practices to episodes of pure rage towards a computer. this last category includes the case of a man who became so mad with his malfunctioning laptop that he threw it in the lavatory and flushed a couple of times. data can disappear as a result of natural disaster system fault or computer virus but human error including computer rage seems to be a growing problem said adrian palmer managing director of ontrack data recovery. nevertheless victims soon calm down when they realise the damage they ve done and come to us with pleas for help to retrieve their valuable information. a far more common situation is when a computer virus strikes and leads to precious files being corrupted or deleted entirely. mr palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their baby s first three months on their computer but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories. data can be recovered from computers servers and even memory cards used in digital devices in most cases said mr palmer. however individuals and companies can avoid the hassle and stress this can cause by backing up data on a regular basis.

swap offer for pirated windows xp computer giant microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones. the first-time initiative is restricted to the uk and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november. until december microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy. the company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of windows into legitimate ones. the windows xp counterfeit project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free subject to certain conditions until the end of the year. it is the first time microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world the company told the bbc news website. in june the software giant said that the major security update to windows xp service pack 2 would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system. the upgrade closed security loopholes in xp and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code. the us company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of windows xp to submit it for testing as soon as possible. the procedure consists of a series of computer checks collating documents and filling out a witness statement. this is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of windows xp software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders said alex hilton licence compliance manager at microsoft. the scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry. it is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce. the plan would enable microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way which would allow it to take action against software pirates. microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the uk programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries.

conservative backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards. the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a tough meeting where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move party sources told the bbc. the bill which ministers claim will tackle crime terrorism and illegal immigration is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats. they have said the scheme is deeply flawed and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been agnostic on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected. it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said. it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards. the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it. the new chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists. what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.

rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men s tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season. rusedski said: i tried to order some but didn t receive any and i haven t got any yet. you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond. this event comes in the hottest period of the year so you would hope the stuff would be available for it. the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements. in response the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination-free drinks and nutritional bars for the men s tour. david higdon vice president of the atp admitted: i agree with greg. i would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but it s a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing. the reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with gsk has an education component. we weren t going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them. the first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the saturday before the australian open. and rusedski who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial. the good thing is that there is now a 100% guarantee so hopefully all this will never happen again said rusedski. hopefully after the australian open we won t have to discuss this any more.

economy focus for election battle britain s economic future will be at the heart of labour s poll campaign chancellor gordon brown has said. he was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. he said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth and would continue to do so. meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle yob culture and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people s fears. in an open letter he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism asylum and crime. he said they should concentrate instead on issues such as the environment international development and the arms trade family policy and the reform of the criminal justice system. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said: we have fought a very positive campaign. i think he will want to look quite carefully at what jack straw said about michael howard. in a speech to the foreign policy centre mr straw said of the tory leader: he is clever fluent and tactical but he is not wise. he lacks strategy and good judgment and his quick temper and impetuosity too often get the better of him. the foreign secretary told the bbc: i was making the observation that because of michael howard s impetuosity you can get lurches of policy. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said: people are already really turned off by the kind of campaign the others are fighting and you will see us putting emphasis on some of these huge issues facing the world particularly the environment. labour s focus on the economy as their key message - came on the day a new report was published by the institute of fiscal studies suggesting that household incomes have fallen for the first time in more than a decade. the ifs says the drop partly reflects measures announced in what it called the chancellor s tax-raising budget of 2002. the treasury dismissed the research as complete rubbish . party election supremo alan milburn said the apparent drop in average incomes was because self-employed people had been affected by a world downturn which hit their profits. since 1997 the reported average take-home income had risen by 20% in real terms if you took out the self-employed mr milburn told bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr brown also dismissed the figures insisting that the typical family has been much better off under labour.

blunkett unveils policing plans people could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in england and wales unveiled by david blunkett. the plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a 10 point compulsory customer charter. the home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police. local people would also be able to trigger action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power. and police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources. mr blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police. the best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms he said but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed. the home secretary s powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after mr blunkett s battle with humberside chief david westwood over intelligence failures on soham murderer ian huntley. opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork. tory spokesman david davis said the proposals were little more than a taxpayer-funded pr exercise ahead of a general election predicted for next may. police forces were already buried under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them said mr davis. earlier lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police. but these measures will only work if they re matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork - and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets. before delivering a statement to mps mr blunkett was joined by tony blair at welling school in south east london which is at the heart of a community policing initiative. mr blunkett said he wanted to go back to a time when i was very young when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work . the prime minister said the law-abiding citizen should be in charge of the community and not the minority who want to cause trouble . mr blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers. he has also started to recruit 25 000 community support officers (csos) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects. an extra £50m was promised on tuesday so 2 000 new csos can be recruited now rather than next year. within two years every force will be expected to keep to a coppers contract on what kind of service the public can expect. a mori poll this summer suggested policing unlike health and education was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it. the plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted. there will also be specific exercises to encourage black and asian people to join the police at senior ranks.

apple attacked over sources row civil liberties group the electronic frontier foundation (eff) has joined a legal fight between three us online journalists and apple. apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products including the mac mini. the eff representing the reporters has asked california s superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources. it argues that the journalists are protected by the american constitution. the eff says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press. apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named asteroid and has asked the journalists e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. rather than confronting the issue of reporter s privilege head-on apple is going to the journalist s isps for his e-mails said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. this undermines a fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters. if the court lets apple get away with this and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news analysis and commentary he said. the case began in december 2004 when apple asked a local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.com and powerpage.org. apple also sent requested information from the nfox.com the internet service provider of powerpage s publisher jason o-grady. as well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. the eff has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with apple including professor tom goldstein former dean of the journalism school at the university of california and dan gillmor a well-known silicon valley journalist. apple was not immediately available for comment.

opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed serious misgivings about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest. michael howard said he would not back the home secretary s plans for control orders which include home detention. i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat. the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders saying: i m sorry. it is a dilemma but there is only one choice. but mr howard said: we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life. he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. mr howard said he feared internment without trial creates martyrs and could be a very effective recruiting sergeant for terrorists . his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to enter into constructive discussions with his party to find a better way forward . controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december 2001 was freed from jail. home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man known only as c certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4 s today programme: it s a matter of principle for us that we can t have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals. the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions. we think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging surveillance limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the home secretary s say so. that must be done with a proper judicial process a judge involved in making those decisions said mr oaten. mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. he said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in serious cases with independent scrutiny from judges.

redford s vision of sundance despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star-struck crowds at sundance. it s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city utah back in the 1980s. now in its twenty-first year sundance continues to grow. some 45 000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind. it s an opportunity to meet and make deals. redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream. smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundance s limelight. but redford is not worried. the more the merrier he says. the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them. once independent film had a place where the work could be seen suddenly the merchants came. with them the celebrities came then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone explains redford. people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film he adds. international film-makers have always been celebrated here but 2005 is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held. redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect particularly how the us is perceived internationally. he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat. but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration. it s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration he says. i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. that s very unhealthy and very dangerous. if we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences. sundance isn t just one big screening. there are discussion panels and q&a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like america s culture wars and the iraq war. while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic. educated middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience. when you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian. and it s about good films and good story-telling be it african america asian women gay lesbian. sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say it s just a film by so-and so .

cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy. all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s convertible peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10% tax. cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in cuba will be affected. critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. in a live television broadcast announcing the measure president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states increasing economic aggression . the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country he said. the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months. president bush s government which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may. cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash says jose barrionuevo head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital. it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue. the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. this money known as remittances can amount to as much as $1bn a year. those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax. their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate. however many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there. cuba s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the un economic commission for latin america is now worth $3bn to the country. the tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for cuba s cash-strapped economy. cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine. much of cuba s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. in recent weeks cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. cuba s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. however a decline in foreign tourism since 2002 periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government s economic problems. the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading mr barrionuevo said. the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries like venezuela which have restrictions on capital he says. mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity. it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long.

more women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks according to a two-year study. the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. the study for net security firm preventon shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. it is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. for the last three years that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. but more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers. the study predicts that 40% of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005. they could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007 if current rates persist according to the research. i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong said one over-60 woman who took part in the research. you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years paul goosens head of preventon told the bbc news website. now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home. but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online particuarly if they are new to broadband he said. programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too said mr goosens. security software should be easy to use with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language he added. the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. high-profile complaints about rogue diallers and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus firewall and spyware-removal programs too. without protection these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally. more than 30 000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses a study from security from symantec showed last year. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer according to net security experts. programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs many based in eastern europe over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because said mr goosens they are reported in the press much more. you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. they are asking the right questions he explained. it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider that they are safe to connect to the net. an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of uk homes will have broadband net access. in july last year the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time according to the office of national statistics.

microsoft sets sights on spyware windows users could soon be paying microsoft to keep pcs free of spyware. following the takeover of anti-spyware firm giant microsoft said it would soon release a toolkit that strips machines of the irritating programs. although initially free microsoft has not ruled out charging people who want to keep this toolkit up to date. surveys show that almost every windows pc is infested with spyware programs that do everything from bombard users with adverts to steal login data. microsoft said that a beta version of the toolkit to clean up windows machines should be available within 30 days. designed for pcs running windows 2000 and xp the utility will clean out spyware programs constantly monitor what happens on a pc and will be regularly updated to catch the latest variants. before now many of microsoft s other security boosting programs such as the firewall in windows xp have been given away free. but mike nash vice president in microsoft s security business unit said it was still working out pricing and licensing issues. charging for future versions has not been discounted he said. we ll come up with a plan and roll that out he said. the plan could turn out to be a lucrative one for microsoft. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that 90% of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that on average each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware. spyware comes in many forms and at its most benign exploits lazy browsing habits to install itself and subject users to unwanted adverts. other forms hijack net browser settings to force people to view pages they would otherwise never visit. at its most malign spyware watches everything that people do with their pc and steals login information and other personal data. microsoft s announcement about spyware comes after it bought small new york software firm giant company software. terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.

bp surges ahead on high oil price oil giant bp has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices. last week rival shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a uk-listed company. bp added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents and that it would continue with share buybacks. bp chief executive lord browne said the results were strong both operationally and financially. the company is earning about $1.8m an hour. despite the record annual profits figure bp s performance was below the expectations of some city analysts. however bp s share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p. its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter. speaking on the bbc s today programme on tuesday lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone. the profits are up more than the price of oil is up he said. lord browne pointed out that bp was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration. we have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low he said. the company has made new discoveries in egypt the gulf of mexico and angola. however lord browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company s huge profits saying that in the north sea it paid progressively more tax the more profits it made. lord browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. currently above $40 a barrel he said: the price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term. bp put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil up 10% on 2003 but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.

india unveils anti-poverty budget india is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen. india s defence budget has also been raised 7.8% to 830bn rupees ($19bn). the priority for finance minister palaniappan chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government s communist allies onside. but his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit which he said would be 4.5% of gdp in the year to march 2005. the country s overall deficit is thought to be more than 10% if the spending of india s 35 states and territories is included. under the fiscal responsibility law mr chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year a target he says he has now met for the current year. but the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3% mr chidambaram said - falling short of the new law s requirement. i was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act he said. the following year though would have to be back on track he warned. i may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means he said. the coming year s reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in india s burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget. presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament mr chidambaram said the indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. he said india s economy grew 6.9% in 2004. in his budget mr chidambaram has: - increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn) - increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn) - announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure - pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims - increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30% - announced a package for the sugar industry in addition up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country s foreign exchange reserves keeping budgeted spending under control. given the resilience of the indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty mr chidambaram said. the whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty. the new indian government led by the congress party was voted into power last may after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a human face . the finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming india s tax system while expanding the tax base. as part of his reforms he has announced: - duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials - expanded service tax net - raised the income-tax threshold to 100 000 rupees ($2 300) - reduced income tax for those earning less than 250 000 rupees ($5 700) to 20% - reduced corporate tax rates to 30% an annual economic survey released on friday said india needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth. but mr chidambaram is under pressure from the communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. the communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will. in recent months they have expressed their displeasure at the government s economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation. in his last budget mr chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers.

no more concessions on terror charles clarke says he has no desire to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book. mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour s majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde tory leader in the lords said ministers should expect it to be substantially re-written . the bill proposes control orders which as well as house arrest could impose curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against. on monday mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order amounting to house arrest would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill . they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals which are for house arrest. but mr clarke told bbc radio 4 s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords. no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords he said. i have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill. mr clarke s proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps. the debate is unlikely to result in a vote. speaking after the commons debate shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been clearly very badly drawn-up and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. he said it would be possible to rescue the government and make the law tolerable by amending it in the lords. the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous he told bbc news. mark oaten for the liberal democrats said monday night s vote showed the government had lost the confidence of all sides of the house . he said: they need to rethink the bill and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects. unless there is a major movement this bill is doomed to fail. bbc news political editor andrew marr said: i think that this is a bill in deep trouble. it s been unravelling in the house of commons - it may unravel further. the government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 march when the current powers expire.

chelsea hold arsenal a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury. thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry s quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry s opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and with his back to goal henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes. gunners keeper manuel almunia who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry s powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal s weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. almost immediately henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save. the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won a dubious free-kick. and given the option to take the 25-yard set-piece quickly henry curled in a shot with cech still organising his wall. this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again. chelsea s main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia. arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked a win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. matthieu flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained chelsea five-point premiership lead over arsenal. almunia lauren toure campbell cole pires flamini fabregas reyes (clichy 82) bergkamp (van persie 82) henry. subs not used: senderos hoyte lehmann. cole. henry 2 29. cech paulo ferreira ricardo carvalho (drogba 45) terry gallas duff tiago (bridge 45) makelele lampard robben gudjohnsen (parker 77). subs not used: kezman cudicini. robben drogba lampard. terry 17 gudjohnsen 46. 38 153 g poll (hertfordshire).

ban hits half-life 2 pirates hard about 20 000 people have been banned from playing the half-life 2 game. game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. copies of half-life 2 had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. experts said the success of the half-life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version. half-life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. authentication involved setting up an account with valve s gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run. in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half-life 2 read the statement. valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the 20 000 represented. one effect of steam s popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game s ranking in the top ten. even so the title debuted at no 3 in the uk charts. valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts. some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account. some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve s anti-piracy actions. in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life 2 keys copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game just to catch pirates and cheats were false. the company said: the hack came from the community as do they all. it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half-life 2 circulating on file-swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys. rob fahey editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system. before now he said it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played. but with this valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half-life 2 he said. if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum said mr fahey other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. it s not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games he said. this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts. unless game firms were careful he said they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.

japan s ageing workforce: built to last in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. and the 101-year-old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life. mr toshitsune is one of japan s 23 000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually and where the oldest member is 114. at his neat osaka detached house where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony. between tasks this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: well what s most important for me is to be japan s number one. mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. and when it comes to longevity japan as a country appears to be doing just that. women can expect to live until 85 men until 78 four years longer than americans and europeans. on the outskirts of kyoto 83-year-old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends who are in their seventies. i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved he remarks. on average we can live longer. whether it s the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes japan s elderly are remarkable. but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. japan is the world s least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us. by 2007 japan s population is expected to peak at 127 million then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. this means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled. in the year 2050 if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo. so how will japan s finances stay on track after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country s gross domestic product (gdp) the highest rate among industrialised countries. the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010 the cost of running japan s welfare state will double to more than 5% of gdp while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. but unfortunately japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. glen wood vice president of deutsche securities japan asks; who s going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform. another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia. but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff. standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york s statue of liberty. but as yet japan is not ready for an ellis island. japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it s an option that s becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists mr wood. in japan as in europe which also faces a workforce decline immigration is a very sensitive subject. but for the japanese economy facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars hi-tech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash. of course the japanese could always have more children. the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia. but there would be no pay back until 2030 when today s babies are taxpayers and the demographic crisis like in europe starts to unfold in 2010. in contrast to japan - and of course the european union - the us population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. although president bush must re-devise social security to take account of a 130% rise in america s over 65s the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration. some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market. they want a shift towards financial services though doubts persist over the country s ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing. japan still has problems getting a viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says mr wood. japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. come 2020 japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. there are fears that the world s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. but none of this is mr toshitsune s concern anymore. at 101 he chuckles that he feels fine.

q&a: malcolm glazer and man utd the battle for control of manchester united has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from us business tycoon malcolm glazer. no formal offer has been made yet but manchester united have confirmed they have received a detailed proposal from the us entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. reports have put the offer at 300p per share which would value manchester united at about £800m ($1.5bn). the approach by the 76-year-old owner of the tampa bay buccaneers american football team is reportedly being led by his two sons avi and joel. a previous approach to the united board by mr glazer in october last year was turned down. however the bbc has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand. mr glazer s previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. that would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed not... in the best interests of the company by manchester united s board when they rejected his approach last year. however mr glazer s latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m. while united s board may be casting a serious eye over mr glazer s latest proposals supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal. supporters group shareholders united - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to mr glazer s campaign - said it would fight any move. manchester united are a debt-free company. we don t want to fall into debt and we don t need to fall into debt shareholders united s sean bones told the bbc. united s players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart rio ferdinand told bbc radio five live. no-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table. the key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of united s largest shareholders the irish horse racing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus. through their cubic expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. mr glazer owns 28.1%. joe mclean a football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was utterly crucial . mr glazer s bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. if that s the case the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence maybe 305. if that s the case then mr glazer might well secure their support - if he does this bid could well go ahead. indeed it is. malcolm glazer was little-known in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late 2003. in february 2004 he said he was considering whether to bid for the club. no bid emerged but mr glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. in october 2004 manchester united said they had received a preliminary approach which turned out to have come from mr glazer. however the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. at the club s annual general meeting in november mr glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. legal adviser maurice watkins commercial director andy anson and non-executive director philip yea were voted out against the wishes of chief executive david gill. but the move led to bankers jp morgan and public relations firm brunswick withdrawing from the glazer bid team.

leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu. the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently-expanded eu. italy and germany also favour an early start to talks but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere. some are worried that turkey s large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult. some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war i-era killing of armenians constituted genocide. there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. mr blair s official spokesman said: the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils. the key issue at this week s council will be that of turkey but they will also discuss a range of other matters.

macy s owner buys rival for $11bn us retail giant federated department stores is to buy rival may department stores for $11bn (£5.7bn). the deal will bring together famous stores like macy s bloomingdale s and marshall field s creating the largest department store chain in the us. the combined firm will operate about 1 000 stores across the us with combined annual sales of $30bn. the two companies facing competition from the likes of wal-mart tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after may s chairman and chief executive gene kahn resigned in january. as part of the deal federated - owner of macy s and bloomingdale s - will assume $6bn of may s debt bringing the deal s total value to $17bn. directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year. may has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as federated and other retailers such as wal-mart. federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges. we have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in america creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence said terry lundgren federated s chairman. some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for may. without this deal may would have been to put it bluntly washed up said kurt barnard president of barnard s retail consulting group. federated has annual sales of $15.6bn while may s yearly sales are $14.4bn.

blair backs pre-election budget tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown s pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy. in a speech in edinburgh the prime minister said thursday s report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour s next election campaign planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme: no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing. that is not what politicians should do it would not be responsible to do. mr brown insisted his spending plans were affordable and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability which he said was the cornerstone of labour s programme. in a speech at edinburgh s napier university he said labour would publish over the next few months a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term . in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity security and stability for all mr blair said. in his pre-budget report mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson from the institute for fiscal studies told bbc news: he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will in fact be ok. we re not so sure. david page of investec securities said: his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £8bn is way too optimistic. it s going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets. conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: i can t find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. in order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election. mr letwin accused the chancellor of using fancy statistics to hide public service failures. vincent cable for the liberal democrats called on mr brown to open up the government s books to the national audit office to see if he had met his golden rule . it is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending mr cable told mps.

councils must find gypsy sites ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments. councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land. more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks said housing minister yvette cooper. in november mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3 500 travellers have no place to stop. ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. that scheme has paid out £25m in four years with £8m available for 2005. there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper. firstly local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. and secondly they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites. the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers. that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment. under the new regulations expected to be in force in the spring officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban. many mps with rural constituencies particularly in eastern england have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments. andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said: we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored. new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers as they often do. living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals legal action and eviction is no one s idea of fun. in their november report mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister responsible for housing said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities said the mps. in turn the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents. two of the most controversial traveller sites - cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.

troubled marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh & mclennan s shareholder transactions the firm has said. the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm s shares. marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation. marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. since that inquiry was launched in october marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. prosecutors allege that marsh - the world s biggest insurance broker - and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york s top law officer eliot spitzer and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california. the sec s investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds managed by mmc capital the company s private equity firm. marsh s new chief executive michael cherkasky is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer. mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate america s misdeeds. the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - standard & poor s moody s and fitch - to downgrade marsh in recent weeks. according to the financial times insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.

bets off after big brother leak a bookmaker has stopped taking bets on celebrity big brother after claiming sensitive information about the channel 4 show had been leaked. william hill made the move after four people tried to place bets on friday s surprise double eviction. this is highly unlikely to have been an inspired guess william hill spokesman rupert adams said. however a big brother spokeswoman was satisfied that sensitive information about the show remained confidential. the bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 1/14. but william hill s overwhelming evidence came on friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the show s surprise double eviction. shortly afterwards model caprice and actor jeremy edwards left the show. mr adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next. we think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners he said. the bets were not taken. mr adams did not believe anyone from channel 4 or big brother producer endemol had tried to place the queried bets. but he added: they need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive information. big brother s spokeswoman said: only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential. we do not feel the need to investigate this further as we are satisfied that these measures are effective. the show s independent adjudicator - the electoral reform services - was also satisfied she added. the current series of celebrity big brother ends on sunday with happy mondays star bez actress brigitte nielsen and blazin squad rapper kenzie competing for a £50 000 charity prize. bookmaker ladbrokes said it would continue to accept bets on the final with kenzie its favourite at 2/9. we felt no need whatsoever to close the book spokesman warren lush said. we ve seen absolutely no suspicious betting patterns. mr lush added that people sometimes vote on short odds because they think it s like buying money . you do have to risk quite a lot of money for a very small gain but if they think there s no chance of an upset they will still do it he said.

enron bosses in $168m payout eighteen former enron directors have agreed a $168m (£89m) settlement deal in a shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm. leading plaintiff the university of california announced the news adding that 10 of the former directors will pay $13m from their own pockets. the settlement will be put to the courts for approval next week. enron went bankrupt in 2001 after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. before its collapse the firm was the seventh biggest public us company by revenue. its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate america. the settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible william lerach the lawyer leading the class action suit against enron said. hopefully this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties he added. under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. the deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of enron s shareholders almost three years ago. so far including the latest deal just under $500m (£378.8m) has been retrieved for investors. however the latest deal does not include former enron chief executives ken lay and jeff skilling. both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm s collapse. neither does it cover andrew fastow who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. enron s shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions jp morgan chase citigroup merrill lynch and credit suisse first boston. the university of california said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in october 2006. it joined the lawsuit in december 2001alleging massive insider trading and fraud claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.

intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light. scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade. we ve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel s photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature dr paniccia - and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it. telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy-to-make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. it s a technical validation that it can work he said.

cheaper chip for mobiles a mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful. the specially-designed chip developed by texas instruments could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3d gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. currently rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. the technology omap-vox is being tested by firms in europe and asia and could appear by the end of the year. texas which makes computer chips for more than half the world s mobile phones said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. we re going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share said doug rasor a marketing vice president at texas. the chip also uses much less power than conventional chips said texas which means less strain on mobile battery life. more than 50 million people own a mobile in the uk but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3g) of mobile technology which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. but it faces stiff competition from the likes of intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles. competition to get people using 3g mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the uk s operators have now launched third generation networks. a recent survey by sony ericsson predicted that the number of 3g handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. many consumers are still to be convinced though. a further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3g phones. many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard. but there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. earlier in january ntt docomo and vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks known as super 3g intended to be 10 times faster than 3g services. the first stage of development is to be completed by 2007 but no date has been set for a commercial launch the newly-designed omap-vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference 3gsm which takes place in cannes france this week.

blair told to double overseas aid tony blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries debt and double aid. some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels oxfam says in a report paying the price. the call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the g8 of top industrialised nations. as rich countries get richer they re giving less and less. this scandal must stop oxfam s barbara stocking said. the world s poorest children are paying for rich countries policies in aid and debt with their lives. 2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure the charity s director added. the report said: for rich countries providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice not an act of charity. it also points out that in 1970 the g8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. but 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable the report says. it argues that the price of not investing in poor countries sustainable development will be felt across the world. the report said: global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. environmental crises and natural disasters disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest. new threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities. criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak. both the prime minister and chancellor gordon brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. mr blair who has described africa as a scar on the world s conscience has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. mr brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to britain by the world s poor nations. a spokeswoman for the department for international development said: the government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. if britain s proposal for an international finance facility were adopted the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier by 2008-09. these additional resources will be used to increase uk bilateral aid to africa to at least £1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least £1.5bn on hiv/aids related work over the next three years.

jones happy with henson heroics wales fly-half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against england. jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales 9-8 down were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff. i knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me jones said. when he said he wanted it there were no problems. jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour before charlie hodgson put england in front with 10 minutes left. i looked at where it was and i knew i was going to struggle to make it jones added. i said to gareth (thomas the wales captain) this is touch and go. it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. he was confident and fancied it. there were no questions that he d miss it the way he was playing. he had a superb game. jones was happy to hail henson s heroic contribution to wales first win over england in cardiff since 1993. physically he s a specimen: he s a balanced player he glides when he runs and obviously he s got a great kicking game as well jones said. his defence was superb he made some great hits and he had a great game. i m glad he s welsh. victory over england for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year s six nations. but they now face three away fixtures in italy france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff. people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby said a proud coach mike ruddock. but we are not there yet. the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. we have to travel this week and we can t afford to get too giddy about this result. we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy. none more so than henson who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian o driscoll. the confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. i m the sort of player who likes pressure on me he said. it makes me more concentrated and i think i perform better under more pressure. i set a high standard against england and i ve got to back it up next week. two years ago when we played italy i wasn t involved and we lost so we ve got to put that right next week.

lasting influence of legend charles ray charles who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music. his sound encompassed so many styles - blues gospel jazz rock n roll even country - and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and r&b scenes. compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators charles songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as joe cocker steve winwood eric burdon and van morrison. his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones with whom he recently recorded a duet. if james brown was the godfather of soul then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. along with sam cooke he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the devil s music of r&b to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists. without charles it is hard to imagine the tear-stained atlantic r&b sound of aretha franklin otis redding or wilson pickett. he was also a talented jazz composer arranger and band leader playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david fathead newman. unfortunately he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction which led to him being arrested in 1965. his string of 1950s atlantic r&b successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock n roll greats including i ve got a woman (roy orbison elvis presley) and hallelujah i love her so (eddie cochran). after the exuberance of his 1959 signature song what d i say charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style recording hoagy carmichael s sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind and the upbeat hit the road jack. he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again. more than 40 years after its release his 1962 abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic. his version of don gibson s i can t stop loving you topped the pop and r&b charts in the us. in 1972 he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people. on it he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder james brown curtis mayfield and marvin gaye. more than 20 years later he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album my world which featured hip-hop beats - although charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged 73 in june 2004 was one from his friend the producer quincy jones who described him as a brother in every sense of the word . there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did he said. former manfred mann singer paul jones who sang on 1960s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la said charles was one of his heroes. i m quite sure my own writing was influenced by him he told bbc news online. i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever.

cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty cardinal cormac murphy-o connor has said. the head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. the cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a terrible waste of money. he and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. speaking on bbc radio 4 s thought for the day slot he criticised the fact that billions have been spent on war instead of being used to bring people out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease . the cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to make history poverty . he added: if the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears. the cardinal will touch on this theme again on friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2 000 at westminster cathedral that peace is worth always striving for . how is it that peace has not arrived the cardinal will ask. how is it that there is war in iraq violence in the holy land and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace how can one wish a happy christmas for our fellow christians in iraq or in the holy land or those who suffer in africa unless you and i in whatever way is open to us say and do what makes for peace both the cardinal and archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in iraq before the war started. dr williams has since criticised the government over its case for war saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system. on friday the cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. it is possible it is real it is worth always striving for because of the promise of our saviour he will say. i also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. a spokesman said downing street had no comment to make. but prime minister tony blair has said he will put africa at the top of the agenda when britain chairs the g8 summit next year.

talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend. five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days britain s biggest union unison will start balloting 800 000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers. the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the less painful option our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice he said. if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. in the 20th century it s completely unacceptable. unison s 800 000 workers the transport and general workers union s 70 000 and amicus 20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.

playstation 3 processor unveiled the cell processor which will drive sony s playstation 3 will run 10-times faster than current pc chips its designers have said. sony ibm and toshiba who have been working on the cell processor for three years unveiled the chip on monday. it is being designed for use in graphics workstations the new playstation console and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. the chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 ghz the firms said. by comparison rival chip maker intel s fastest processor runs at 3.8 ghz. details of the chip were released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco. the new processor is set to ignite a fresh battle between intel and the cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 while toshiba plans to incorporate it into high-end televisions next year. ibm has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year. cell is comprised of several computing engines or cores. a core based on ibm s power architecture controls eight synergistic processing centres. in all they can simultaneously carry out 10 instruction sequences compared with two for current intel chips. later this year intel and advanced micro devices plan to release their own multicore chips which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once. the cell s specifications suggest the playstation 3 will offer a significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in a product announcement will find their way into systems. any new technology like this has two components said steve kleynhans an analyst with meta group. he said: it has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it. then there s the reality of how it s really going to be used which generally is several levels down the chain from there. while the playstation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use cell the chip s designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications from servers to mobile phones. initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console however because the first version of the cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan. and while marketing speak describes the chip as a supercomputer - it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world s top 500 supercomputers. ibm said cell was os neutral and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if microsoft s windows was among those tested with the chip. if cell is to challenge intel s range of chips in the marketplace it will need to find itself inside pcs which predominantly run using windows.

khodorkovsky quits yukos shares jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant yukos to a business partner. mr khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company group menatep - which controls yukos - to leonid nevzlin. a close ally of the ex-yukos boss mr nevzlin is currently based in israel. mr khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of yukos core oil production unit yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill. yuganskneftegaz was sold off at auction in december last year eventually falling into the hands of state oil firm rosneft in a deal worth $9.4bn (£5bn). since the sale of yuganskneftegaz i have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group s money as a whole mr khodorkovsky said. it is all over. as before i see my future in public activity to build a civil society in russia. mr nevzlin is yukos largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in israel. yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day. it was sold by the russian authorities to recover government tax claims against yukos totalling over $27bn. previously considered to be russia s richest man with an estimated fortune of $15bn mr khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in october 2003. however the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the country s super-rich business leaders the so-called oligarchs. it is also believed that mr khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of mr putin.

csi shows give unrealistic view people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows real experts say. evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes at a time when many have large backlogs science investigators claim. lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used. the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc. crime scene investigation (csi) and its spin-offs csi: miami and csi: new york have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic. each episode a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal. the csi effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show said max houck who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university us. this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science (aaas). the american forensics expert said there were roughly 200 000-300 000 backlogged dna samples in us labs. yet these constituted just 10% of the total test backlog said dr houck. forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the show s influence in dealing with the families of victims. what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case she explained. for example on television the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. but when people find out that it can take several months they can find that very difficult. dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people s perceptions. the show s influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom making lawyers jittery. prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because for example they wonder: why wasn t everything tested well in fact not everything needs to be tested dr houck explained. defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that s always accurate. however he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. my university course started with four graduates in 1999; we re now the largest major on campus - with 400 students he said. dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: there s more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.

what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays one starbucks one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens. both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories new headquarters in victoria street just down the road from the commons. that should make things a little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off. unlike 2001 there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside or to buy scooters to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events. and to all intents and purposes we already appear to be in that general election campaign. certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator alan milburn in the rather compact new conference room - still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained - had all the hallmarks of an election event. welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre he said. and i ll bet he hadn t checked that one with gordon brown. along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare-to-work scheme which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300 000 in unemployment. and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save £35 billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering £4 billion of tax cuts. labour has come up with a figure of £22 billions worth of efficiency savings so understandably perhaps believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra £13 billion. these figures based on the two parties own detailed studies will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign. wednesday was just the start.

eu rules won t stop uk spending the shape of the uk s economy in graphics but he denied that he was ruling out british membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. mr brown said that it was vital the uk continued to invest in infrastructure science and education in the future. otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of china he told mps. the chancellor said that the eu s planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle. under mr brown s rules the uk current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. he told the house of commons treasury select committee that the eu rules make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure . but he argued that the eu was moving in the direction of the uk principles and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year to include investment and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. under mr brown s sustainable investment rule government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact. mr brown vigorously denied conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. in march the office of national statistics (ons) reclassified £3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only £6bn. conservative michael fallon asked mr brown whether the treasury had leaned on ons to make this change and said that the ons had received a written paper from the treasury on this matter. but the chancellor said mr fallon was impugning the integrity of the office of national statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. mr brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. he told the treasury select committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost treasury coffers. earlier ex-conservative chancellor ken clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. speaking on radio 4 s today programme mr clarke said political give and take would replace more rigid rules. but fellow tory david heathcoat-amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run europe s varied economies on one set of rules. the essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake he said. the warning is about the european constitution which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. it gives more powers to brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy. but speaking to the treasury select committee gordon brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. the conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact mr. brown said.

parmalat sues 45 banks over crash parmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit italian dairy company went bust last year. the firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros ($19bn; £10bn) and new boss enrico bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders. he claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions. parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time. under italian law administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble. the firm also said it is preparing further law suits. according to the reuters news agency 35 of the companies sued on thursday are italian while the remaining 10 are international. the unidentified parmalat source also told reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. among those already targeted are bank of america ubs credit suisse first boston deutsche bank and citigroup. it has also gone after auditors grant thornton. they have all denied any wrongdoing. parmalat was declared insolvent in december 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist. in the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company among other things had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. that enabled parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas allowing it to become a darling of the italian stock exchange.

wru proposes season overhaul the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks. the season would start with the celtic league in october followed by the heineken cup in february and march and the six nations moved to april and may. after a nine week break the wru then proposes a two-month period of away and home international matches. wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country. he added: we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation. equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure. moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued. the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed. pickering added: it s very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it - not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important. we ve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits.

uk heading wrong way - howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said. britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded: britain is working don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said. we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp. yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever. he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain. how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them. the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice. worst of all it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today. the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change. this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account. but labour spokesman mr kemp said: it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april not 1 january. let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment 15% interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax. with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country.

uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez s agrarian reform programme. officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios or large rural estates which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure. the firm whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters they plan to seize 12 900 acres (5 200 hectares) from the 32 000 acre (13 000 hectare) farm. officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters. as a consequence the government has taken action. controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th century. critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country s poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added: agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land. the company pointed out that the farm which employs 300 workers provides meat solely for the venezuelan market. last month the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40 000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had nothing to fear . under president chavez the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state s involvement in the country s economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.

man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals. rooney received a hostile reception but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes free-kick. marcus bent missed everton s best chance when roy carroll who was later struck by a missile saved at his feet. rooney s return was always going to be a potential flashpoint and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooney s every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes rising to meet ronaldo s cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent played onside by gabriel heintze hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldo s low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton s rescue three minutes later when rooney s big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes free-kick took a deflection and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo who reacted first to score easily. everton s problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney s desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs but once again martyn denied the england striker. - manchester united coach sir alex ferguson: it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out. the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player. he s persistent and never gives in. i don t know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again he s truly a fabulous player. everton: martyn hibbert yobo stubbs naysmith osman carsley arteta kilbane mcfadden bent. subs: wright pistone weir plessis vaughan. manchester united: carroll gary neville brown ferdinand heinze ronaldo phil neville keane scholes fortune rooney. subs: howard giggs smith miller spector. referee: r styles (hampshire)	[sport (1.0)]	[sport (0.9998)]

by banks in particular. i don t think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website. he added: the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability. ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said. card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. if we do that they will indemnify us he said. many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual s identity. several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget. last year a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate. on average people have to remember four different passwords. some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. in a separate survey by rsa 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. for many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard. activcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that. rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. activcard s method is more complex. it is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with uk banks. steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification. the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online. the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both. the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions. you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given. if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction. the clever bit happens back at the bank s secure servers. the code is validated by the bank s systems matching the information they expect with the customer s unique key. each individual gets a key which is unique to them. it is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash. it means that in a typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode. by the time they go back [to use the information] the code has expired so they can t prove who they are according to mr ash. in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards. the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants (pdas) and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them. the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said.

howard taunts blair over splits tony blair s feud with gordon brown is damaging the way the uk is governed tory leader michael howard has claimed in a heated prime minister s questions. mr howard asked: how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other that question was later unveiled as the headline for new tory campaign posters. but mr blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people s priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by labour. he can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages low inflation low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to he said. the chancellor is currently on a high-profile tour of africa to highlight new anti-poverty plans. but before doing so he insisted he still trusted mr blair despite claims to the contrary in a new book. brown s britain by robert peston says there is mutual animosity between the two men. it claims mr blair said in november 2003 he would stand down as prime minister before the next election. but he went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him it says. mr peston s book claimed that mr brown told mr blair: there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe. mr blair directly denied that quote on wednesday. he again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit. the tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor. he declared: he is the deals on meals prime minister. no wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater. he continued: how can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government how can they clean up our hospitals when they don t clean up their act mr blair said he would not respond to tittle tattle in books and promised to hail labour s record on the economy waiting lists and law and order from now until polling day . later at their poster launch tory co-chairman liam fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how juvenile the prime minister and chancellor were. labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on tuesday where mr brown was joined by alan milburn who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. but liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc news: the government is clearly split at the top. this kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody. later this week mr blair is expected to outline the direction of his party s next election manifesto. the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made mr peston s book.

broadband in the uk growing fast high-speed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever. bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the 600 000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million. nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe. according to figures gathered by industry watchdog ofcom the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km. asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps though faster connections are available. this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas said paul reynolds chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. bt retail which sells net services under its own name also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition and dwindling influence in other sectors. local loop unbundling (llu) in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer s home or office is growing steadily. cable & wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called carrier pre-section (cps) services such as talktalk and one.tel which route phone calls across non-bt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.

millions to miss out on the net by 2025 40% of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home says a study. around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million or 50% of the uk who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is wishful thinking the report concludes. the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts. the gap between have-nets and have-nots has been much talked about but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests. internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it said adrian hosford director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits said mr hosford. as now the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families the older generation and the disabled. those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025 the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome he said. if we don t address this problem now it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society he said. the alliance for digital inclusion an independent body with members drawn from government industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.

manufacturing recovery slowing uk manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one-and-a-half years in january according to a survey. the chartered institute of purchasing and supply (cips) said its purchasing manager index (pmi) fell to 51.8 from a revised 53.3 in december. but despite missing forecasts of 53.7 the pmi number remained above 50 - indicating expansion in the sector. the cips said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high. the survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs. that triggered the second successive monthly fall in the cips employment index to 48.3 - its lowest level since june 2003. the survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam. it appears that the uk is in a two-tier economy again said prebon yamane economist lena komileva. you have weakness in manufacturing which i think would concern policymakers at the bank of england.

viewers to be able to shape tv imagine editing titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of star wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest. manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new 7.5m euro (£5.1m) project funded by the european union. new media for a new millennium (nm2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. viewers will be able to participate in storylines manipulate plots and even the sets and props of tv shows. bt is one of 13 partners involved in the project. it will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in cctv pictures. the software uses content recognition algorithms. the three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs. one of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the tv audience. participants will text selected words which will impact how the characters in the drama interact. it is being developed in finland and will be shown to finnish tv audiences. another team will work on the bbc s big budget drama of mervyn peake s gothic fantasy gormenghast. it will be re-engineered to allow people to choose a variety of edited versions. the bbc is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles explained dr doug williams of bt who will be nm2 s technical project manager. the tv at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals. this project is about teaching the machine to look at content like lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense he said. at the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive tv which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. we are hoping to occupy the space in-between he added. nm2 s co-ordinator peter stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience. viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes he said. media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers. it will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said john wyver from tv producer illuminations television limited which is also involved in the project. it s not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production said mr wyver. the tool has to know which bits fit together both visually by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing and in terms of the story. only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing he added. mr wyver is planning a production entitled the golden age about renaissance art. it will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry music and architecture. other productions that the nm2 team will make range from news documentaries to a romantic comedy drama.

crisis ahead in social sciences a national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up a committee of mps has said. there was an absolute crisis in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts the commons science and technology committee added. major problems are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age it said. the committee was reporting on the work strategy and spending plans of the economic social research council. the council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. it also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. in its report on the council s work the committee said: we are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting in particular the qualitative branches of social sciences. this mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry it said. it is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of economic and social research council s limited resources. if the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this. a national strategic capabilities fund to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response the committee added.

french wine gets 70m euro top-up the french government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction. the financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed. the french wine industry the world s second largest has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of new world wines. wine makers however claimed the support did not go far enough. the package was announced by agriculture minister dominique bussereau after talks with vintners representatives. the bulk of the money - about 40m euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments. a further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives which make up the majority of french producers in low interest loans. efforts to promote french wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding. france fell behind the new world producers of australia chile and the united states for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports. domestic consumption accounting for 70% of sales has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws. the aid package would create a positive climate around french viticulture mr bussereau said. however wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. i am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions jean-michel lemetayer from the fnsea agricultural union told the associated press news agency. in an effort to tackle overcapacity the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement. the government will also seek european union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol with vintners receiving compensation. production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%. the support is designed to make french producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry. wine makers in france s best-known regions such as burgundy have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers.

digital guru floats sub-$100 pc nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit s media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53). he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood . he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linux-based operating system we have to get the display down to below $20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. the second trick is to get rid of the fat if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory. the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on. while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. we put in 25 laptops three years ago only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook. mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim we re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years we re talking about months. he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. in china they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. that s for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.

parties plans for council tax anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003 when the average english bill rose 12.9%. pensioners protests spread - some marched others simply refused to pay the increase. some such as 83-year-old elizabeth winkfield said they would rather go to jail. the audit commission found the whole local government finance system was fundamentally flawed and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change. labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils budgets to keep demands down. deputy prime minister john prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be radical reform . the party says this year s increases will be the lowest in a decade. a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation such as reformed business rates although no decisions have been made. an independent inquiry into its findings the lyons review is due to report back at the end of 2005. the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. they say they can save £4bn on government waste of which £1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners bills by an average of £340. it would not be means tested say the tories because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill up to a maximum of £500. the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band. the liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa norway and switzerland. the rate would be set locally but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least £300m. they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain because it puts a ceiling on what the richest pay. the party says it would aim for a £5 000 tax-free personal allowance or a £7 000 allowance for the over-65s. after that income would be taxed up to £100 000. the lib dems say their plan is fairer more efficient has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.

giving financial gifts to children your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs for example. the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age through its new child trust fund. the first vouchers worth £250 or £500 for low-income families will be distributed from january. all children born after 1st september 2002 will be eligible. parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april 2005. parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1 200 a year which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children s deposit account and use this as a feeder fund. there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the alliance & leicester firstsaver which pays 5.25% also starting at £1. interest earned by children is subject to income tax. however children like adults have a personal income tax allowance (£4 745 for the current tax year). if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance then no tax will be payable. when the account is opened a form r85 available from the bank or building society should be completed. this confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax. the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. where interest exceeds this level the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. therefore it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1 200 limit being directed to a deposit account. another favourite solution is premium bonds. with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account they make great presents. the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian. the minimum for each purchase is £100 and bonds are sold in multiples of £10. there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored. over the longer term stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment although in the shorter term they can be volatile. one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. these funds may be actively managed where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential or passive where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index for example the ftse 100. exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). the difference is that the charges are quite low. the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18 and parents will have no control over how it is spent. for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.

t-mobile bets on pocket office t-mobile has launched its latest pocket office third-generation (3g) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access. unlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data the device selects the fastest one itself. the mda iv released in the summer is an upgrade to the company s existing smartphone the 2.5g/wi-fi mda iii. it reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. the device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer or as a conventional clamshell phone. the microsoft mobile phone with two cameras and a qwerty keyboard reflects the design of similar all-in-one models released this year such as motorola s mpx. one in five european workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office rene obermann t-mobile s chief executive told a press conference at the 3gsm trade show in cannes. he added: what they need is their office when they are out of the office. t-mobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls office in a pocket devices with 100 000 mdas sold in europe already. in response to demand t-mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped blackberry to its mobile range. reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office it announced it would introduce a flat-fee £20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the uk using its wi-fi hotspots. it said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from 12 300 to 20 000. it also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services such as the uk s london to brighton service to provide commuters a fast net connection too. the service which has been developed with southern trains nomad digital (who provide the technology) begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early march to the end of april. a full service is set to follow in the summer. wi-fi access points will be connected to a wimax wireless network - faster than wi-fi - running alongside the train tracks. brian mcbride managing director of t-mobile in the uk said: we see a growing trend for business users needing to access e-mail securely on the move. we are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey. he said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services such as that offered on gner trains did not offer yet. mr obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future. thousands of mobile industry experts are gathered in cannes france for the 3gsm which runs from 14 to 17 february.

rover deal may cost 2 000 jobs some 2 000 jobs at mg rover s midlands plant may be cut if investment in the firm by a chinese car maker goes ahead the financial times has reported. shanghai automotive industry corp plans to shift production of the rover 25 to china and export it to the uk sources close to the negotiations tell the ft. but rover told bbc news that reports of job cuts were speculation . a tie-up seen as rover s last chance to save its longbridge plant has been pushed by uk chancellor gordon brown. rover confirmed the tie-up would take place not very far away from this time . rover bosses have said they are confident the £1bn ($1.9bn) investment deal would be signed in march or early april. transport & general worker s union general secretary tony woodley repeated his view on friday that all mergers led to some job cuts. he said investment in new models was needed to ensure the future of the birmingham plant. this is a very crucial and delicate time and our efforts are targeted to securing new models for the company which will mean jobs for our people he said. saic says none of its money will be paid to the four owners of rover who have been accused by unions of awarding themselves exorbitant salaries the ft reports. saic is extremely concerned to ensure that its money is used to invest in the business rather than be distributed to the shareholders the newspaper quotes a source close to the chinese firm. meanwhile according to chinese state press reports small state-owned carmaker nanjing auto is in negotiations with rover and saic to take a 20% stake in the joint venture. saic was unavailable for comment on the job cuts when contacted by bbc news. rover and saic signed a technology-sharing agreement in august.

apple laptop is greatest gadget the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc. the 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs. the magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two. gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device . in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine. in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded. the oldest gadget in the top 100 is the abacus which the magazine dates at 190 a.d. and put in 60th place. other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position) the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the kodak brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10 which also includes the first flash mp3 player (diamond multimedia) as well as the first successful digital camera (casio qv-10) and mobile phone (motorola startac). the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13. sony s third entry in the top 20 is the cdp-101 cd player from 1983. who can forget the crystalline hiss-free blast of madonna s like a virgin emanating from their first cd player asked the magazine. karl elsener s knife the swiss army knife from 1891 is at number 20 in the list. gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd) the nintendo gameboy (25th) and the pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). the list also contains plenty of oddities: the pez sweet dispenser (98th) 1990s toy tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th). almost everyone has a mobile phone how many people own a powerbook or an ipod the findings of this magazine are not very convincing. what about the magnetic compass we still use it 1 000 years after it was invented. i am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre. for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc flash mp3 portable cd players etc. are really just improvements in technology. my favourite true gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee! calm down it s only in their opinion and any list that includes the taser in the top 100 gadgets has to be suspect.... swiss army knife and no question about it. how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful/popular you don t need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out! this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses. brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair; whilst the americans focus on apple tv remotes and tivo (which probably is rather obscure in europe). what about the soda stream. this gadget changed my pre-teen life. lap tops may enable you to think different but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy how about astro wars one of the pioneers for computer games i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today! however tried it the other day and it was rubbish still a great gadget of its time. why worry about mobile phones. soon they will be subsumed into the pda s / laptops etc. what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. for it s time a technological marvel! sony net minidisc! it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it. a laptop computer is not a gadget! it s a working tool! the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well. how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors. are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly. has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy 100. the size of a4 paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible. what s an apple powerbook 100 it s out of date - not much of a gadget . surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time. the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule. the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off. all top 10 are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anything else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20. sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multi-takings os. shame the marketing was so bad!!! apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else. utter rubbish. yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition. i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top. how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise) what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine 12 years ago. still wearing and using it a lot! it stood the test of time. psion organiser series 3 should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable. case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first i think). great product innovation. the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that. the motorola startac should be number one. why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices. the psion series 3c! the first most practical way to carry all your info around... i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now. i d have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model. sinclair spectrum - 16k. it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now. i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple s newest offerings -- were more like the pb100. particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses. they re invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use. congratulations to apple a deserved win!

fa charges liverpool and millwall liverpool and millwall have been charged by the football association over crowd trouble during their carling cup match on 26 october. millwall who lost the match 3-0 have also been charged over alleged racist behaviour by their supporters. during the match at millwall s new den stadium seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. a disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation. liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the hillsborough disaster where 96 supporters were crushed to death in april 1989. but lions chairman theo paphitis has denied the claims. he has said cctv footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a liverpool fan attacking a millwall fan in the west stand. however millwall have been charged with two breaches of fa rules. they have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and/or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch. liverpool have been charged with one breach for failing to prevent their fans conducting themselves in threatening and/or violent and/or provocative behaviour. both clubs have until 23 december to respond.

yahoo celebrates a decade online yahoo one of the net s most iconic companies is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week. the web portal has undergone remarkable change since it was set up by stanford university students david filo and jerry yang in a campus trailer. the students wanted a way of keeping track of their web-based interests. the categories lists they devised soon became popular to hundreds of people and the two saw business potential in their idea. originally dubbed jerry s guide to the world wide web the firm adopted the moniker yahoo because the founders liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude unsophisticated uncouth person. the term was popularised by the 18th century satirist jonathan swift in his classic novel gulliver s travels. we were certainly not sophisticated or civilised mr yang told reporters ahead of the anniversary which will be officially recognised on 2 march. they did have business brains however and in april 1995 persuaded venture capitalists sequoia capital which also invested in apple computer and cisco systems to fund yahoo to the tune of $2m (£1.04m). a second round of funding followed in the autumn and the company floated in april 1996 with less than 50 employees. now the firm employs 7 600 workers and insists its dot com culture of work hard play hard still remains. it is one of just a handful of survivors of the dot-com crash although it now faces intense rivalry from firms such as google msn and aol. jerry yang who remains the firm s chief yahoo is proud of what the company has achieved. in just one decade the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything - and it s been a remarkable and wonderful experience he said. through it all we wanted to build products that satisfied our users wants and needs but it s even more than that - it s to help every one of us to discover get more done share and interact.

high fuel prices hit ba s profits british airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. reporting its results for the three months to 31 december 2004 the airline made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. rod eddington ba s chief executive said the results were respectable in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. ba s profits were still better than market expectation of £59m and it expects a rise in full-year revenues. to help offset the increased price of aviation fuel ba last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. in october it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. yet aviation analyst mike powell of dresdner kleinwort wasserstein says ba s estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. looking ahead to its full year results to march 2005 ba warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. however it said sales would be better than previously forecast. for the year to march 2005 the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated ba chairman martin broughton said. ba had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue. it also reported on friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in january. aviation analyst nick van den brul of bnp paribas described ba s latest quarterly results as pretty modest . it is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development however operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong he said. since the 11 september 2001 attacks in the united states ba has cut 13 000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products mr eddington said. for example we have taken delivery of six airbus a321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our club world flat beds. ba s shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.

labour pig poster anti-semitic the labour party has been accused of anti-semitism over a poster depicting michael howard and oliver letwin - who are both jewish - as flying pigs. prospective tory candidate andrew mennear whose finchley constituency contains a large jewish community branded it tasteless and offensive. the poster shows the two men s faces superimposed on winged pigs and says the day the tory sums add up . labour said the poster was not anti-jewish but anti-tory . it is one of four designs e-mailed to labour members who were asked to vote for their favourite. mr mennear who was sent the e-mail by a friend said he had been shocked by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified. he said there was nothing more distasteful for a jewish person than to be associated with a pig. i am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent but these sort of things can cause great offence. it clearly wasn t thought through. it is possible the posters were designed for maximum impact but this one clearly overstepped the mark and should be withdrawn. the campaign was particularly insensitive as it had come out at the same time as holocaust day a difficult time for many jewish people mr mennear added. a labour spokesman denied the campaign was anti-semitic. as we said at the time the james report (the tory backed inquiry into possible public spending savings) was published pigs will fly before the tory s sums will add up. this poster is making a serious point he said. a conservative party spokesman said: while the conservatives are concentrating on the issues that matter to people such as lower taxes and controlled immigration it is clear to see that the labour party is not. people will not be fooled.

mogul wilson backing uk rap band tony wilson the music mogul who established the influential factory records in the 1980s is to launch a new label - convinced he has discovered his third major band . factory were the label of both joy division - who became new order after singer ian curtis committed suicide - and the happy mondays. now wilson believes rap act raw t - signed to his f4 label the fourth incarnation of factory - will complete the hat-trick . suddenly when raw t came into my life i realised they are my third major band he told bbc world service s the music biz programme. the group are set to release their first single on 21 february and follow it up with an album realise and witness in march. wilson has twice tried to resurrect factory - which lasted for 14 years before folding - but conceded these efforts had been despondent and dismal experiences . but it has not put him off. of all the things i do in my life the most exciting thing i ve ever done and the thing i have most loved is being part of a record company he added. the idea of working with brilliant young musicians and being close to the centre of popular culture is just the biggest thrill in my life. wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see raw t but he had initially been reluctant saying he detested young british people rapping. it s always inauthentic it s always crass it never really works for me he said. i went to see this group raw t - which stands for realise and witness talent - and like everyone else in the room that night we were utterly blown away. wilson believes raw t could be to f4 as joy division were to factory records . the story of factory records - which also owned the legendary hacienda club in manchester - was told in the michael winterbottom film 24 hour party people in which wilson was played by steve coogan. wilson stressed that the independent music scene remained as important as it had been during the 1980s when labels such as factory and rough trade proliferated. he pointed out that franz ferdinand and the white stripes - perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium - were signed to indies. i think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is and how bands prefer it he added. they can make more money that way - it s a more generous relationship and also it s a more understanding relationship. i think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.

ultra fast wi-fi nears completion ultra high speed wi-fi connections moved closer to reality on thursday when intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year. intel is developing ultra-wideband technology (uwb) which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs. uwb is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless usb devices which need low power consumption. a rival uwb standard is being developed by motorola and chip firm freescale. at the mobile phone conference 3gsm in cannes last month samsung demonstrated a phone using uwb technology from freescale. at a press conference on thursday intel announced that two uwb groups wimedia alliance and multi-band ofdm alliance had merged to support the technology. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. consumer electronics companies want uwb to replace cables and simplify set-up jeff ravencraft technology strategist at intel and chairman of the wireless usb promoter group told technology site zdnet. thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer couldn t set up the equipment. the first products using uwb technology from intel are due to hit the market later this year. initially they will be products using wireless usb 2.0 connections. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. intel says the benefit of uwb is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi wimax and mobile phone networks.

borders rail link campaign rally campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a borders rail link which was closed in 1969 to be reopened. they will mark the 36th anniversary of the line closure which ran from edinburgh through the borders and on to carlisle with a walk at tweedbank. anne borthwick of campaign for borders rail said reopening the waverley line would restore the area s prosperity. msps are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through midlothian to the borders. campaigners have said that reopening the waverley line which could cost up to £100m would be a huge economic boost for the borders. in 2000 borders council said the area s economy had suffered since the closure. ms borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the scottish executive. we are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the waverley line she said. campaign for borders rail is the biggest independent lobby group in scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the borders and eventually to carlisle. we believe that it is time for the scottish executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between edinburgh and tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future. ms borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the scottish borders. a study in 2000 which was commissioned by the executive scottish borders council midlothian council and scottish borders enterprise found that a half-hourly service from tweedbank to edinburgh could cover its operating costs. it also found that a half-hourly service from gorebridge to edinburgh could cover operating costs and that a freight railway joining the west coast main line at longtown could also be reinstated.

$1m payoff for former shell boss shell is to pay $1m (£522 000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves. judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer. in january 2004 shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. shell said the pay-off was in line with ms boynton s contract. she was leaving by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities the firm said in a statement. the severance package means she keeps long-term share options but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it. the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman sir phil watts and production chief walter van der vijver. an investigation commissioned by shell found that ms boynton had to share responsibility for the company s behaviour. despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had fooled the market about its reserves the investigation said she did nothing to inquire further. in all shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. in september it paid £82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.

borders 19-20 ulster ulster clung on for a morale-boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night. a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish but the scottish side could not complete the fightback. ulster had led 20-6 with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham. but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by charlie hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. substitute joe pattison - who had come on for the injured gareth morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase. the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time giving adam larkin an easy conversion. ally warnock clawed back three points for borders but they were soon hit by another double-blow. first mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward. larkin again added the extras. even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin-binned. the hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart however when warnock struck a penalty at the other end. and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. ulster coach mark mccall said he was delighted to get the victory. borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time said mccall. in the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries. morton moffat macrae hore berthinussen warnock moore thomson ford douglas blair stewart gray brown mcentee. kay parr mcgee rennick weston millar pattison. cunningham maxwell bell steinmetz howe larkin campbell s. best shields moore frost mccullough ward feather n. best. brady mccormick longwell browne doak s. young bowe. phil fear (wru)	[sport (1.0)]	[sport (0.9999)]

plaid mp s cottage arson claim a plaid cymru mp believes uk security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on welsh extremists. it is 25 years since the start of 12 years of fire-bombings attributed to a shadowy group known as meibion glyndwr. plaid cymru s elfyn llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote. ex-welsh office minister lord roberts of conwy denied security services were involved. in march this year north wales police reopened the case saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield dna evidence. meibion glyndwr - which means sons of glyndwr - began burning property in december 1979 in protest at homes in rural wales being sold as holiday cottages to people from england. the group was linked to most of the 220 or so fire-bombing incidents stretching from the llyn peninsula to pembrokeshire. the campaign continued until the early 1990s. police were accused in some quarters of targeting anyone who was a nationalist. although one man sion aubrey roberts was convicted in 1993 of sending letter bombs in the post the arson cases remain unsolved. as a solicitor elfyn llwyd represented welsh singer bryn f&#244;n when he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the arson campaign. f&#244;n was released without charge . but now as mp for merionnydd nant conwy and plaid cymru s parliamentary leader mr llwyd has argued that some of the terror attacks may have had the involvement of the security services and not meibion glyndwr. he believes that elements of the british security services may have carried out renegade actions in order to discredit plaid cymru and the nationalist vote ahead of elections. the claim is made in an interview for bbc wales maniffesto programme to be shown on s4c on sunday. mr llwyd said that the sophistication of many of the devices used in the attacks compared to the crude nature of many others suggests a degree of professionalism which could only have come from individuals who knew exactly what they were doing. he said: what i m saying is that the role that they took wasn t the appropriate one i.e. like an agent provocateur and perhaps interfering and creating a situation where it looked like it was the nationalists that were responsible. the programme also heard from lord roberts of conwy who was a welsh office minister at the time. he denied that the security services played any improper role. mr llwyd s theory has also been questioned by plaid cymru s former president dafydd wigley. he accepted that the fires damaged plaid cymru s public image but believed that the security services had their hands full at the time with the ira and animal rights activists. - maniffesto can be seen on s4c on sunday 12 december at 1200 gmt.

parliament s record of scandal in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal. sex betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson. few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den. for sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what s there online. until 1857 the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings dating back to 1670 all recorded among the 325 000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament s victoria tower. most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love. this gives them the chance. divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses. among the records is the story of jane campbell the first woman ever to divorce her husband. that happened in 1801 after she had discovered her husband edward addison had committed adultery with her sister jessy. a transcript of evidence from jessy s maid amelia laugher shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. it must have been a killer blow to addison s case - he had already fled abroad rather than pay the £5 000 damages ordered by a civil court. as well as making divorce history jane campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time. but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament. there are the protestation returns from 1642 - lists of the protestants who pledged to maintain the true reformed protestant religion . there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament including composer george frideric handel in 1727. and the mass of private bills which for example authorise the building of railways and roads contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them. tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about 300m and is longer than the palace of westminster itself listing the names of appointed tax collectors. this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room. but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. david prior assistant clerk of the archives says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research. before you just could not do it you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material he says. mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally. the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change mainly motivated by the potential of it which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us he says. the archives do of course hold records of high (and low) politics too for both houses of parliament including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk. records for the commons only date back to 1834 - anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in 1834. but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history - parts of the bill of rights from 1689 the death warrant for charles i the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law. there is also the 1606 act establishing 5 november as a thanksgiving day - the year after the gunpowder plot. that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the 400th anniversary of guy fawkes conspiracy. as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat s skin): all human life is here.

beastie boys win sampling battle us rappers beastie boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song pass the mic. the punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist james newton s choir in their track from 1992. although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample mr newton said his copyright had been infringed. but the us court of appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. the beastie boys - michael diamond adam horowitz and adam yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music. sampling now a standard practice among musicians involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. a three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of mr newton s recording. that finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the beastie boys. we hold that beastie boys use of a brief segment of that composition consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background c note is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of newton s copyright chief judge mary schroeder wrote in her opinion. mr newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist composer performer and university professor. mr newton and the beastie boys were not available for comment.

consumer concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops a survey says. more than half of 2 000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk france germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number. more than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham capgemini s principal consultant on rfid said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology. acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers the industry can reach this point. he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings including clothes could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners it warned.

christmas sales worst since 1981 uk retail sales fell in december failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst christmas since 1981. retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in december after a 0.6% rise in november the office for national statistics (ons) said. the ons revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in november to 3.2%. a number of retailers have already reported poor figures for december. clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth according to the ons. the last time retailers endured a tougher christmas was 23 years previously when sales plunged 1.7%. the ons echoed an earlier caution from bank of england governor mervyn king not to read too much into the poor december figures. some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. the november-december jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. and figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending an indication that consumers are looking for bargains and retailers are cutting their prices. however reports from some high street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. morrisons woolworths house of fraser marks & spencer and big food all said that the festive period was disappointing. and a british retail consortium survey found that christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years. yet other retailers - including hmv monsoon jessops body shop and tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year. investec chief economist philip shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates. the retail sales figures are very weak but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night you don t really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter said mr shaw. our view is the bank of england will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture.

imf agrees fresh turkey funding turkey has agreed a draft proposal with the international monetary fund to borrow $10bn (£5.19bn) extending its ongoing financial support until 2007. turkey s current $18.6bn loan agreement with the imf expires in february and the new deal would see it receive added support between 2005 and 2007. in return for the funding turkey would be expected to keep inflation under control and introduce market reforms. turkey s economy has steadily recovered from a severe crisis in 2001. economic growth has average 6-7% in the past three years ahead of imf forecasts while inflation fell below 10% this year for the first time in 30 years. however turkey has a huge debt burden - already owing $23bn to the imf - while its current account deficit has swelled to $10.7bn this year. the turkish economics minister ali babacan said the two sides had reached general agreement on a new three year funding program. rodrigo de rato the imf s managing director said the loan agreement would help to improve turkish economic prospects by cutting its debt and stimulating growth. i believe the new programme if implemented successfully will help turkey create the conditions for sustained growth and employment creation reduce inflation toward european level and enhance the economy s resilience he said. the agreement must still be ratified by imf directors at a meeting expected to take place next month. the agreement would also enable turkey to defer payments on previous loans worth $3.7m until 2006. as part of the draft agreement turkey has signed a letter of intent stating its determination to push through far-reaching reforms to its tax and benefits system and its banking sector. such reforms are considered vital for turkey if it is to fulfil its ambition of joining the european union. the eu will decide on 17 december whether to begin entry talks with turkey. the us the largest of the imf s 184 members is a strong supporter of continued financial support for turkey.

lifestyle governs mobile choice faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests. instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in-depth study by handset maker ericsson. historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab. we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said. we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website. for the study ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. people s habits remain the same said dr bjorn. they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it. one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people he said. while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways. dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago. this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch. another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it. once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off. dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. however he said now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. in 2003 the figure was 29%. similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. in 2003 only 4% of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month. now the figure is 14%. similar rises have been seen in many other european nations. dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said. digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays. by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.

venezuela reviews foreign deals venezuela is to review all foreign investment in its mining industries in an effort to strengthen its indigenous industrial output. president hugo chavez has ordered all existing contracts with foreign firms to be examined to see if they provide maximum benefits to the country. the review will cover production of gold aluminium and iron ore although it excludes the country s oil sector. chavez has sought to extend the state s role in all sectors of the economy. the left-wing president is conducting a controversial review of land ownership in the country while also seeking to create a state-run telecoms firm to compete with foreign-owned businesses. he has argued that major economic reforms are vital to improve the lives of venezuela s poorest citizens. announcing the review of raw material production minister victor alvarez said the government would seek to transfer technology training capability and content from projects with foreign partners. we are defending our national sovereignty over the use of our national resources which must serve the endogenous development of the nation mr alvarez said. for this reason we are reviewing all memorandums of understanding all letters of intent all agreements that have been signed all contracts to check which of these comply with these directives. everything absolutely everything has to be reviewed. venezuela has previously assured foreign companies with operations in the mineral rich country that it respects existing contracts. however the government insisted that it needed to develop its own industrial infrastructure in order to create new jobs and lessen its reliance on foreign partners. if we don t do this we are just going to carry on being slaves suppliers of raw materials all our lives and we will never develop our own productive capacity mr alvarez added. companies from the united states canada france and switzerland all have substantial investments in venezuela s mining sector.

minister hits out at yukos sale russia s renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed a senior government figure has warned. economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was unjustified . his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm s assets into public ownership. on 28 december another senior economic adviser called the sale the swindle of the century . yuganskneftegaz the unit which produced 60% of yukos output had been seized and sold in december for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal. baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom. we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference. now officials are doing it. within days he was stripped of most of his responsibilities. mr gref a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov s comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz should it become a state-owned company must be privatized he said. today our government is ineffective and state companies as a result are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well. and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. if we follow that logic we should nationalise all businesses he said. many large russian companies particularly in the energy sector use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes. mr gref also poured cold water on president putin s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people s lives mr gref told kommersant. we don t need simply to increase gdp but to improve its structure. instead of focusing on headline growth figures russia needed to focus on better institutions such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.

uk set to cut back on embassies nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money uk foreign secretary jack straw has announced. the bahamas east timor madagascar and swaziland are among the areas affected by the biggest shake-up for the diplomatic service for years. other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. mr straw said the move would save £6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism. honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed mostly in europe and america. they include dallas in the us bordeaux in france and oporto in portugal with local staff replacing uk representation in another 11. the changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006 with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. in a written statement mr straw said: the savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the foreign and commonwealth office s strategic priorities including counter- proliferation counter-terrorism energy and climate change. some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. in africa for instance we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region with a new post in nairobi to help support our work on climate change one in nigeria to cover energy and one in pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering maseru and mbabane. the foreign office currently has about 6 100 uk-based staff. it has opened major new missions on baghdad and basra in iraq kabul in afghanistan and pyongyang in north korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding wednesday s cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. the shake-up is aimed at helping making £86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. the chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. but the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that british commercial interests and the interests of britons abroad will not be adversely affected he said.

fast moving phone bugs appear security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs. the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system. despite the warnings there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir. the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time. however the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone s battery. anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian s series 60 software is licenced by nokia lg electronics lenovo panasonic samsung sendo and siemens.

trade gap narrows as exports rise the uk s trade gap narrowed in november helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the european union. according to the office for national statistics the difference between what the uk exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn) down from october s £3.6bn. overall uk exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to £24.8bn although total imports rose again to a new record of £27.9bn. the deficit for goods alone was £4.6bn down from october s £5bn. during november the uk exported £16.9bn worth of goods but imported £21.5bn. the cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36.3bn £4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003. november saw an improvement in export levels to both the european union and the rest of the world the office for national statistics (ons) said. eu exports rose 2% fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. non-eu exports shot up 7.5% with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars consumer durables and chemicals. the export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. non-eu imports rose 3% but the growth in goods entering the uk from the eu slowed to 0.5%. the uk s deficit with the eu fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn while its non-eu shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in october. the country s surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. paul dales uk economist for capital economics said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. however he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain. the figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor he said. there have been some very encouraging signs that the uk export recovery is starting to take hold. but there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.

search sites get closer to users search sites want to get to know you better. not content with providing access to the millions of websites many now offer ways that do a better job of remembering cataloguing and managing all the information you come across. some of the latest to update their search systems are ask jeeves and blinkx which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web. the future is all about developing your own personal web said tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves. mr macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it because there was no memory of what they had searched for before. each time you go back in you have to start all over again he said. the series of updates to its service collected under the my ask jeeves banner would help people remember where they had been before. ask jeeves has added the ability to save websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found. sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved. mr macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists cannot be easily searched. on average said mr macklin users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in my ask jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily. under my ask jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting. it s about finding again what you found before he said. the my ask jeeves service lets people store up to a 1000 web links or 5000 if they sign up to the free service. by way of comparison google s desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited. at the same time search start-up blinkx has released a second version of its eponymous software. blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on be it a document or e-mail and suggests websites video clips blogs or documents on a pc that are relevant to it. since blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as google copernic enfish x1 and apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their pc as well as the web. the competition has validated the problem we tackle said suranga chandratillake co-founder of blinkx. in the latest release of blinkx the company has added what it calls smart folders. once created the folders act as persistent queries that automatically sweep the web for pages related to their subject and catalogues relevant information documents or incoming e-mails on hard drives too. what users do with blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines. blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems he said. they might use google to look up a company or yahoo for travel because they know they are good at that he said. the classic thing we have seen recently is people using blinkx to look at the things they have searched on he said. the variety of ways to search data was only helping users said mr chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks.

cyber criminals step up the pace so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004 say security experts. the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus. in its end-of-year report messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. in september 2003 messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. worryingly said the firm phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data. older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity said mark sunner chief technology officer at messagelabs. in just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online he said. mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed indicating a shift from the random scattergun approach to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses he said. although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004 viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating. to date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. in 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. but by the end of 2004 almost three-quarters of messages were junk.

cyber crime booms in 2004 the last 12 months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague windows pcs. the count of known viruses broke the 100 000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%. similarly phishing attempts in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers called bot nets used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes. one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus said kevin hogan senior manager in symantec s security response group. although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code said mr hogan 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs. the financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology he said. his comment was echoed by graham cluley senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm sophos. mr cluley said: when the commercial world gets involved things really get nasty. virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum. in particular phishing attacks which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers boomed during 2004. web portal lycos europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. the anti-phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages. they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses said mr hogan. they are very noisy and they are not technically challenging. the opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the netsky bagle and mydoom mass mailers but since then more surreptitious viruses or worms have dominated. mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in bot nets that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites. in september symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active bot computers rose from 2 000 to 30 000 per day. thanks to these bot nets spam continued to be a problem in 2004. anti-spam firms report that in many cases legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages. part of the reason that these bot nets have become so prevalent he said was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. in the past many viruses such as netsky have been the work of an individual or group. by contrast said mr hogan the code for viruses such as gaobot spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. the result is that now there are more than 3 000 variations of the spybot worm. that s unprecedented said mr hogan. what makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology. the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004. in the past threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild. in june the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short-range radio technology. also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones. on the positive side finnish security firm f-secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers. in total eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29a virus writing group were sentenced. one high-profile arrest was that of german teenager sven jaschen who confessed to be behind the netsky and sasser virus families. also shut down were the carderplanet and shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers.

house prices rebound says halifax uk house prices increased by 1.1% in december the first monthly rise since september the halifax has said. the uk s biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004 but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. the average price of a house in the uk now stands at £162 086 halifax said. the survey seems to fly in the face of recent evidence that the uk housing market has been slowing substantially in response to interest rate rises. last week the nationwide said that house prices fell 0.2% in december with annual inflation running at a three year low. on tuesday figures from the bank of england showed that the number of mortgages approved in the uk has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. new loans in november fell to 77 000 from 85 000 in october the lowest rate since september 1995 the bank of england said. growth in unsecured lending such as personal loans and credit cards also slowed last month. capital economics which has in the past predicted a sharp fall in uk house prices branded halifax s findings a temporary surprise which would be reversed over the coming months. the month by month volatility of the halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is a clear downward trend in house prices a capital economics statement said. experts believe five interest rate rises since november 2003 are cutting borrowers appetite for debt. despite recording a price rise in december the halifax survey concluded that there was continuing signs of a genuine slowdown in the housing market. martin ellis halifax chief economist said that there was no need to revise the bank s prediction made last month that prices would fall by 2% in 2005. sound housing market fundamentals will continue to underpin the market in 2005 ensuring that the market remains healthy and that house prices fall only slightly mr ellis said. if the bank s prediction of a 2% price drop comes true it will be the first annual fall in nine years. the bank said that the recent pattern of house prices rising the fastest in the north of england continued in december. in the north west and yorkshire and the humber halifax said prices rose by 3% and 1.2% in the two regions respectively during the month. at the other send of the scale prices in the south east and london fell by 1.6% and 0.5% respectively. the biggest decline was seen in wales where prices fell by 6.2% an area that had experienced strong house price growth during most of 2004. overall halifax said prices in the final quarter of 2004 were 0.1% higher than in the previous quarter. this was the smallest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 2000 the bank said. as a result annual house price inflation dipped below 20% during the final few months of 2004.

wales stars need a rest - ruddock wales coach mike ruddock has defended his decision not to release any of the international stars for this weekend s regional celtic league fixtures. ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress. we ve got the wru charter in place now which outlines exactly what happens ruddock told bbc wales sport. once we re in the six nations the players will only be released in his and the wru s best interests. the ospreys and scarlets say they are happy to support the wales cause but the dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in friday s game with ulster. ceri sweeney gareth cooper ian gough and kevin morgan have been used sparingly by ruddock in the opening two six nations wins and captain jason forster believes they would benefit from a game with the dragons. i m sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time forster told bbc wales sport. it would also be a timely reminder to mike [ruddock] as to what they can do. and the supporters want to see the star players - no disrespect to the other guys - performing on the pitch. ruddock though is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue. at this stage there s nothing more [the players] can do in games to impress me further. we ve got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region. for example the dragons might use james ireland this weekend. i ve been looking at the lad - he s a great prospect for the future. french and english clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means stephen jones gareth thomas and mefin davies will play this weekend. the majority of ireland and scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.

analysis: no pain no gain he called it his masochism strategy in the run-up to the iraq war and now tony blair has signed up for another dose of pain. the idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of real voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. the theory is that talking to the great british public even if they are the great unwashed is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people s concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election. labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin control freakery and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps. tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. mr blair s latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday. the trouble began on the wright stuff show with maria hutchings marching up to him saying tony that s rubbish as she tried to complain about her autistic son s school being threatened with closure. a few don t worries as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show. but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce. writer neil coppendale from west sussex asked of the iraq war: tens of thousands of innocent men women and children died - how do you manage to sleep at night on immigration london teacher diane granger said: where are you going to put everyone and can you imagine even jeremy paxman putting the question posed by brighton nurse marion brown: would you wipe somebody s backside for £5 mr blair tried to use the questioners first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems. many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a pr stunt which backfired. indeed there is a danger mr blair simply ends up looking embattled . conservative michael howard and liberal democrat charles kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month. labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence. james humphreys ex-head of corporate communications at number 10 says the strategy shows frustration with the media. they feel they don t get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion he says. there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls he argues. the prime minister knows full well the potential hazards . he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign. all you do is walk around and make yourself known you don t do anything to help anybody she told mr blair before stomping off refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. former downing street media chief alastair campbell has described the episode as a bit of a disaster as it meant the launch of labour s election manifesto received little coverage. but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive not least because it coincided with john prescott s even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester. former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public. the undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was margaret thatcher discomfort on nationwide in 1983 when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war. john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox. it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added fizz to his campaign. in his memoirs he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnock s contrived photo opportunities and attempts at an artful campaign. he wanted to look like a prime minister. i was prime minister and i wanted a flesh and blood fight says mr major. mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment . but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips. mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him: always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day. his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim: no pain no gain.

celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam play-off in three weeks time. but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french. no-one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on 12 march - sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham. but how the mighty have fallen. england sat on rugby s summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 grand slam winners. but they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in sydney. and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon play-off against italy in a fortnight. england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in 1987. coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost a phalanx of world cup stars. and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team. the same year that england ruled the roost a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations. and they won only two games against scotland and italy in 2004. wales most recent championship title was in 1994 and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al. but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age. after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations. the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with a broken thumb accurate kicking from either fly-half stephen jones or centre gavin henson a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams. ireland coach eddie o sullivan and captain brian o driscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearly-men tag that has dogged them for the past few years. the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners-up for the past two years to france and england. but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a grand slam in 1948. as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland (twice) and wales since joining the elite in 2000. coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials. and so to france. brilliant one minute inept the next. but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door. ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings. welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam. but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on 12 march.

green reports shun supply chain nearly 20% more uk top 250 firms produced non-financial reports on social and environment issues than last year. but of the 145 companies reporting 76% didn t examine their supply chains says the annual directions survey. green groups say putting pressure on supply chains is a major way companies can reduce their environmental impact. the survey is published by corporate social responsibility firm context and branding firm salterbaxter. blake lee-harwood campaigns director at greenpeace in the uk said: it s fairly meaningless to talk about your company s direction in terms of sustainability without having detailed knowledge of your supply chain. it s also important to get some kind of independent assessment of your reporting. less than a quarter of companies (24%) get their corporate social responsibility (csr) reports independently verified to provide assurances they are accurate and complete says the survey. to date there are no set standards for non-financial reporting although the global reporting initiative an independent pro-sustainability institution is planning to establish some. the reports surveyed by directions are published voluntarily. they are usually called corporate social responsibility (csr) reports sustainability reports or social and environmental reports. peter knight director of context says 24 uk top 250 companies reported for the first time this year and in general the quality of reports has improved. the corporate lexicon of homilies generalities and soft assurances - fluff - is on its way out. there are less pictures of smiling children and butterflies. the uk government will soon require all quoted companies to report their social and environmental risks in a chapter in their annual reports called the operating and financial review. the regulation is not expected until 2005 and the first reports under this scheme will not be published before 2006. the us seems to lag europe in producing corporate social responsibility reports. the majority of european top 50 companies (44) publish them and only 27 of the us top 50.

wal-mart is sued over rude lyrics the parents of a 13-year-old girl are suing us supermarket giant wal-mart over a cd by rock group evanescence that contains swear words. the lawsuit filed in washington county alleges wal-mart deceived customers by not putting warning labels on the cover. trevin skeens alleges wal-mart knew of the offending word because it had censored it on its music sales website. wal-mart said it was investigating the claims but had no plans to pull the cd. wal-mart has a policy of not stocking cds which carry parental advisory labels. mr skeens said he bought the anywhere but home cd for his daughter and was shocked to hear the swearing when it was played in their car. i don t want any other families to get this expecting it to be clean. it needs to be removed from the shelves to prevent other children from hearing it said mr skeens of brownsville. the lawsuit seeks to force wal-mart to censor the music or remove it from its stores in maryland. it also seeks damages of up to $74 500 (£38 660) for every customer who bought the cd at maryland wal-marts and also naming record label wind-up records and distributor bmg entertainment in the legal action. while wal-mart sets high standards it would not be possible to eliminate every image word or topic that an individual might find objectionable wal-mart spokesman guy whitcomb told the herald-mail of hagerstown.

jones files conte lawsuit marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs. the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. conte whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday conte said: i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit filed in the us district court in san francisco said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements the suit added were false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month jones lawyer richard nicholls said: marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never ever used performance-enhancing drugs. victor conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory. mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination. mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed. the sport s ruling body the iaaf is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. if it is felt there is case to answer it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action he added. the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. and i am sure like ourselves they will be watching the television programme with great interest. jones who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones who did not win any medals in athens in august has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile conte who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering is due to face trial in march.

us consumer confidence up consumers confidence in the state of the us economy is at its highest for five months and they are optimistic about 2005 an influential survey says. the feel-good factor among us consumers rose in december for the first time since july according to new data. the conference board survey of 5 000 households pointed to renewed optimism about job creation and economic growth. us retailers have reported strong sales over the past 10 days after a slow start to the crucial festive season. according to figures also released on tuesday sales in shopping malls in the week to 25 december were 4.3% higher than in 2003 following a last minute rush. wal-mart the largest us retailer has said its december sales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of strong post-christmas sales. it is expecting annual sales growth of between 1% and 3% for the month. consumer confidence figures are considered a key economic indicator because consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the united states. the continuing economic expansion combined with job growth has consumers ending this year on a high note said lynn franco director of the conference board s consumer research centre. and consumers outlook suggests that the economy will continue to expand in the first half of next year. the overall us economy has performed strongly in recent months prompting the federal reserve to increase interest rates five times since june.

campbell returns to election team ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell will return to the fold to strengthen labour s general election campaign the party has confirmed. mr campbell has consistently made public his keenness to play a part in the poll expected in may. both culture secretary tessa jowell and deputy prime minister john prescott have welcomed his return. he is a strong labour party member mr prescott told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme. mr campbell quit number 10 in august 2003 after being tony blair s right-hand man at the 1997 and 2001 elections. labour have refused to discuss his exact new position and have not said how it would affect his downing street replacement david hill. of course alastair s going to be part of the election campaign and i think that all of us who will also be part of the election campaign are very pleased about that ms jowell told sky news. but she said his return would not put anybody else s nose out of joint . this is the daft thing about the way in which politics is written about ms jowell added. there s room for everybody. we serve the country better if we make room for all the talent. a labour source told the sunday times mr campbell would effectively front the election media campaign but said he would be given no formal title. labour strategists told the paper he would be set loose on conservative leader michael howard in attacking his party s economic record when it was in power. they used pictures from the 1970s in the 1992 campaign to remind people of the winter of discontent - and now it s our turn the source told the paper. making michael howard leader gives us an unmissable opportunity to remind people what it was like to pay mortgage rates of 15% even if it was more than a decade ago. mr campbell was at the centre of the government s row with bbc over andrew gilligan s story about the iraq weapons dossier. the hutton inquiry cleared him of sexing up the dossier in the run-up to the iraq war. since leaving downing street he has toured the country with his one man show an audience with alastair campbell and presented a number of interview programmes for channel 4.

progress on new internet domains by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names. the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net s administrative body. the names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann. the other proposed names include a domain for pornography asia mobile phones an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture. the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices. the .travel domain would be used by hotels travel firms airlines tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. it is backed by a new york-based trade group called the travel partnership. icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. a similar proposal has been made many times in the past. but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.
